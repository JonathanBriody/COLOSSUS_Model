Co-authors:

Annette feels Rodrigo should be on this paper as he suggested considering the Angiopredict study.
Annette said that as Matias Ebert, a gastroenterologist in Germany, is on both COLOSSUS and Angiopredict, he should be on the paper.
This collaboration may also help us to get some of the cost data that we've been waiting on from Germany (in the end it didnt).

Annette feels that all the PIs on Angiopredict should be co-authors on this paper Matthias Ebert as mentioned above, Jochen Prehn and Bauke Ylstra.
I would probably like to add Qiushi Chen, dependent on how helpful his thoughts on parametric survival analysis actually turn out to be.

Authors (final list TBD): Jonathan Briody, Ian Miller, Rodrigo Dienstmann, Lesley Tilson, Matthias Ebert, Jochen Prehn, Bauke Ylstra, Annette Byrne, Kathleen Bennett.
