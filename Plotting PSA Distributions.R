# Double Check Parameterization of Random Variables:

# Qiushi suggested I  double-check the parameterization of the `shape1` and `shape2` parameters  (which correspond to alpha and beta in my code) when I back-calculate from mean and variance. This is because different sources (like Wikipedia or other references) and different software may use different parameterizations for the beta and gamma distributions.

# Parameterization refers to the way parameters are defined for a distribution. For example, a beta distribution is typically defined by two shape parameters (`alpha` and `beta`). However, these parameters can be defined in different ways depending on the source or software. This can sometimes lead to confusion and errors if not properly checked.

# Qiushi suggested a  practical way to verify my parameterization: generate some random values from the distribution using my calculated parameters, plot a histogram of these values, and visually check if the distribution looks as expected, has the exected values and falls within the expected range. If the parameters are mismatched, the distribution might look off, or the values might fall outside the expected range.

# He's basically advising caution and verification when working with statistical distributions, to ensure that my calculations and assumptions align with the specific parameterization used by the R software. This is a common practice in statistical analysis and modeling to ensure the accuracy and validity of the results. 

# If the generated data doesn’t look right (for example, if it falls outside the expected range), it could indicate that there’s a problem with the parameterization of your beta distribution.

# Here’s how to  generate some random values from the beta distribution, plot a histogram, and visually check the distribution.

# First, I need to make sure everything is labelled, to entitle the plots, I should have done this with my tornado plots earlier:


# Add the comment (label)
# comment(P_OSD_SoC) <- "probability of dying in OS treatment following test test under standard of care"
# variable_label <- comment(get(plotted_variable))

# In the existing PSA code which calls this plotting file I create the variable speicific mean, max and min and calculate the alpha and beta parameters for the variable in question and set the variable as plotted_variable as follows to ensure I can repeat this piece of code easily for each variable: plotted_variable <- "P_OSD_SoC"

# So, I can immediately generate some random values from my beta distribution using these parameters and plot a histogram:
  
random_values <- rbeta(n_runs, shape1 = alpha, shape2 = beta)

# To check if the distribution has the expected mean and variance, I can calculate these statistics from my random values:
  
# Calculate the mean and variance of the data
data_mean <- mean(random_values)
data_var <- var(random_values)

# I can  then compare these values to the expected mean and variance. If they are close, this suggests that my parameterization is correct, but more on this in the comments at the bottom of this file.

# Calculate the mean and variance of the theoretical distribution
# For a beta distribution, the mean is alpha / (alpha + beta) - supported by https://statproofbook.github.io/P/beta-mean.html#:~:text=Proof%3A%20Mean%20of%20the%20beta%20distribution&text=E(X)%3Dαα,X(x)dx.
# and the variance is (alpha * beta) / ((alpha + beta)^2 * (alpha + beta + 1)) - supported by https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/12232/calculating-the-parameters-of-a-beta-distribution-using-the-mean-and-variance
theoretical_mean <- alpha / (alpha + beta)
theoretical_var <- (alpha * beta) / ((alpha + beta)^2 * (alpha + beta + 1))

# As part of my plotting, I want to  overlay the theoretical beta distribution curve on my histogram. I do this by using the curve function in R:
  
# First, I generate the histogram of my random values without plotting it:  

# Generate histogram of random values
hist_data <- hist(random_values, plot = FALSE)

# Open a graphics device to save the plot to a file
png(filename = paste0(plotted_variable, "_", country_name, "_histogram.png"), width = 800, height = 600)


# I was experiencing issue due to the size of the plotting area being too small for the amount of content I'm trying to fit in. I can try adjusting the margins of the plot to make more room for the title. The par function in R allows you to set graphical parameters, including the margins of the plot (mar), which is specified as a vector of four values indicating the number of lines of margin to be specified on the bottom, left, top, and right of the plot, respectively.


# Adjust the margins (bottom, left, top, right)
par(mar = c(5, 4, 4, 2) + 0.1)

# In this code, par(mar = c(5, 4, 4, 2) + 0.1) sets the bottom margin to 5 lines, the left margin to 4 lines, the top margin to 4 lines, and the right margin to 2 lines. You can adjust these values as needed to create more space for your title.

# In R, the `par` function is used to set or query graphical parameters. Parameters can be set by specifying them as arguments to `par` in tag = value form.

# The `mar` parameter is one of the graphical parameters that can be set using `par`. It sets the margin sizes in lines. The `mar` parameter takes a numerical vector of the form `c(bottom, left, top, right)` which gives the number of lines of margin to be specified on the bottom, left, top, and right of the plot.

# So, when you see `par(mar = c(5, 4, 4, 4) + 0.1)`, it's setting the bottom margin to 5.1 lines, the left margin to 4.1 lines, the top margin to 4.1 lines, and the right margin to 4.1 lines. The `+ 0.1` is adding 0.1 to each of the values in the vector `c(5, 4, 4, 4)`, resulting in `c(5.1, 4.1, 4.1, 4.1)`.

# This is done to ensure that all the elements of the plot (like the main title, axis labels, legend, etc.) fit within the plotting area and do not get cut off at the edges. By increasing the size of the margins, you're essentially increasing the space available for these elements.

# The xpd parameter in the legend function allows the legend to be placed outside the plot area, but it doesn’t change the clipping region of the plot. This means that while the legend can technically be placed outside the plot area, it may still be clipped and not visible if it extends beyond the outer margins of the plot.

# To ensure the legend is fully visible, you can increase the right margin of the plot to make more room for the legend, as above.

# In the code `par(mar = c(5, 4, 4, 4) + 0.1)`, the `+ 0.1` is adding 0.1 to each of the values in the vector `c(5, 4, 4, 4)`. This results in a new vector `c(5.1, 4.1, 4.1, 4.1)`.

# The `par(mar = ...)` function in R is used to set the margins of the plot. The `mar` parameter is a numerical vector of the form `c(bottom, left, top, right)` which gives the number of lines of margin to be specified on the bottom, left, top, and right of the plot.

# So, `par(mar = c(5, 4, 4, 4) + 0.1)` is setting the bottom margin to 5.1 lines, the left margin to 4.1 lines, the top margin to 4.1 lines, and the right margin to 4.1 lines. This slightly increases the size of the margins compared to `par(mar = c(5, 4, 4, 4))`. 
 
# This can be useful for making sure that text and other elements don't get cut off at the edges of the plot.

# The + 0.1 was used as an example to show how you can programmatically adjust the margins if needed. For instance, if you wanted to increase all margins by a certain amount based on a variable in your code, you could use this approach. 

# Next, I normalize the histogram (so that the total area is 1), and plot it:
  
# Normalize and plot histogram
hist(random_values, freq = FALSE, main = "", xlab = "Values", ylim = c(0, max(hist_data$density) * 1.2))

# In this code, freq=FALSE in the hist function ensures that the histogram is normalized and represents a probability density. 

# Then, I add theoretical beta distribution curve
curve(dbeta(x, shape1 = alpha, shape2 = beta), add = TRUE, col = "darkblue", lwd = 2)

# Overlaying the theoretical beta distribution on your histogram is a great way to visually compare your data to the expected theoretical distribution. The dbeta function in R gives the density of the beta distribution for given alpha and beta parameters. Remember, the histogram and the theoretical beta distribution are plotted on different scales. The histogram shows the actual frequencies of your data, while the theoretical beta distribution shows the expected probabilities. So, they might not match exactly, but they should have similar shapes if your data follows a beta distribution.

# Here, dbeta is the density function of the beta distribution, which gives the height of the probability density function at each point x. The curve function then adds the theoretical beta distribution curve to the existing plot.

# The dbeta function is used to generate the density of the beta distribution for a sequence of x values. The add=TRUE argument ensures that the curve is added to the existing plot rather than creating a new one. The col and lwd arguments set the color and line width of the curve, respectively.

# This will give a histogram of my random values with the theoretical beta distribution curve overlaid on top.

# The curve should closely match the shape of my histogram if my parameterization is correct.

# If my data doesn’t follow a beta distribution, then the theoretical distribution curve and the histogram of my  data might look very different.

# I can add vertical lines to my plot using the abline function in R. 

# Add vertical lines for mean, min, and max
abline(v = mean, col = "red", lwd = 2, lty = 2)  # Mean
abline(v = min, col = "green", lwd = 2, lty = 2)  # Min
abline(v = max, col = "blue", lwd = 2, lty = 2)  # Max

# In this code, abline(v = value) adds a vertical line at the specified value. The col parameter sets the color of the line, lwd sets the line width, and lty sets the line type (1 = solid, 2 = dashed, etc.).

# This will add vertical lines at the mean, min, and max values to the histogram. The mean line is red, the min line is green, and the max line is blue.




# Add rug plot
rug(random_values, col = "darkred")

# In this code, rug(random_values) adds a rug plot at the bottom of the histogram, which shows the individual data points as small vertical lines.

# Add legend for mean and variance of data and theoretical distribution
legend("topright", inset = c(-0.037, 0), legend = c(paste("Data Mean: ", round(data_mean, 3)), paste("Data Variance: ", round(data_var, 3)), paste("Theoretical Mean: ", round(theoretical_mean, 3)), paste("Theoretical Variance: ", round(theoretical_var, 3)), "Mean (red line)", "Min (green line)", "Max (blue line)", "Rug plot (dark red ticks)", "Theoretical Beta Distribution (dark blue curve)"), cex = 0.8, xpd = TRUE)

# Instead of specifying the coordinates directly, you can use the inset parameter in the legend function to adjust the legend position relative to the corner of the plot. The inset parameter takes a two-element numeric vector indicating the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) distances from the corner of the plot.

# In this code, inset = c(-0.2, 0) shifts the legend 20% of the plot width to the left from the top right corner. You can adjust these values as needed to move the legend to the desired position. The negative value for the x-coordinate shifts the legend to the left.


# Add title
title(main = paste("Histogram with Beta Distribution for", variable_label, "in PSA for", country_name), line = 2, cex.main = 1)

# Decrease the size of the title text: You can use the cex.main argument in the title function to adjust the size of the title text. cex.main is a numerical value giving the amount by which plotting text and symbols should be scaled relative to the default. 1=default, 1.5 is 50% larger, 0.5 is 50% smaller, etc. In this code, cex.main = 0.8 decreases the size of the title text by 20%.





# Close the graphics device
dev.off()


# OK, that worked, but the title is now written over the legend and part of the plot, it also appears quite low down in the image and the start and end of the sentence are cut off, can you bring it back to the top of the image and also make sure the start and end of the title are no longer cut off?
  


# This will create a histogram of 10,000 random values drawn from the beta distribution with your calculated alpha and beta parameters. The x-axis represents the values and the y-axis represents the frequency of each value.

# To interpret the histogram, most of the values should fall around the mean (0.17), and the shape of the histogram should roughly match the shape of a beta distribution. If the histogram looks very different from what is expected, or if many values fall outside the expected range (0.12 to 0.22 in this case), this might indicate a mismatch in the parameters.

# Here’s what you should look for in the histogram:
  
#  Shape: The histogram should have the shape of a beta distribution. This means it should be unimodal (one peak) and skewed to the right or left, or it could be symmetric depending on the alpha and beta parameters.

# Center: Most of the data should cluster around the mean (0.17 in this case). This is where the peak of the histogram should be.

# Spread: The values should fall within the expected range (0.12 to 0.22 in this case). If many values fall outside this range, it might indicate a problem with the parameters.

# Outliers: If there are any bars far away from the others, these could be outliers. If there are any, it might be worth investigating why these values are being generated.




# Some of the bins of the histogram fall outside the vertical lines at the min and max values, which suggests that the random values I’ve generated from my beta distribution are not entirely within the expected range.


# This could be due to a few reasons:
  
  # Parameterization: The parameters alpha and beta I’ve calculated might not be accurate, leading to a beta distribution that doesn’t match my expectations.
# Randomness: The rbeta function generates random values. By nature of randomness, it’s possible to get values that are quite far from the mean, especially if the number of random values I'm generating (n_runs) is not very large.
# Distribution Assumption: The beta distribution might not be the best fit for my data. If my data is not actually beta-distributed, then the random values generated from a beta distribution might not accurately reflect my data.

# I feel it's unlikely to be a problem with my calculations:, as I checked the manner in which I cacluated everything with Qiushi and Joshua, including how I calculated the alpha and beta parameters (which was also originally informed by the Andrew Briggs course), and the standard error.
# I also don't think I need to check my distribution assumption: I could consider whether a beta distribution is the best fit for my data and try fitting other distributions to my data to see if they provide a better fit, but I chose beta for probabilities and the other distributions for the costs and utilities based on the literature, and this is extensively discussed in my notes in the R markdown file.

# I think because the histogram bins are small and close to the min and max, my parameterization is likely correct, and the beta distribution is a reasonable fit for the data.

# That is, the presence of a few bins beyond the min and max values, especially when they are small and I'm generating a large number of random values (n_runs = 10000), is not necessarily a cause for concern. This could simply be due to the inherent randomness in the process of generating random numbers from a distribution.

# The beta distribution is a continuous probability distribution, which means it can theoretically take on any value between 0 and 1. When you generate random numbers from this distribution, most of the values will be close to the mean, but a few might fall in the tails of the distribution, beyond my specified min and max values. This is a normal characteristic of random number generation and doesn’t necessarily indicate a problem with my parameterization or my distribution assumption.

# However, if a significant proportion of my values fall outside the expected range, or if the values that fall outside the range are very far from the expected min and max, then this might indicate a problem. In such a case, I might want to revisit my calculations or consider whether a different distribution might be a better fit for my data.










# This is just a visual check. For a more rigorous verification, I  might want to consider statistical tests or other methods at some point in the future. But this should give me a good starting point. 


# For a more rigorous check, I  might want to compare the empirical mean and variance of my generated data to the theoretical mean and variance of the Beta distribution with my calculated parameters. 

# Copilot suggests I can do this in R with the mean() and var() functions as follows:

# Calculate empirical mean and variance
# empirical_mean <- mean(random_values)
# empirical_variance <- var(random_values)

# Print empirical mean and variance
# print(paste("Empirical mean: ", empirical_mean))
# print(paste("Empirical variance: ", empirical_variance))

# Calculate theoretical mean and variance of Beta distribution
# theoretical_mean <- alpha / (alpha + beta)
# theoretical_variance <- (alpha * beta) / ((alpha + beta)^2 * (alpha + beta + 1))

# Print theoretical mean and variance
# print(paste("Theoretical mean: ", theoretical_mean))
# print(paste("Theoretical variance: ", theoretical_variance))

# If the empirical mean and variance are close to the theoretical mean and variance, then your parameterization is likely correct. If not, you may need to revisit your calculations or check the parameterization used by your rbeta function.

# I responded that Surely the empirical mean and empirical variance you calculated and the theoeretical mean and theoretical variance you calculated will always match as the apha and beta that are used to calculate the theoretical mean and variance were themselves used to create random_values variable?


# You're correct in your understanding. The theoretical mean and variance are derived from the `alpha` and `beta` parameters, and these are the same parameters used to generate the random values from the Beta distribution. Therefore, if the random values are generated correctly, the empirical (sample) mean and variance should be close to the theoretical mean and variance.

# However, due to the randomness involved in generating the random values, the empirical mean and variance might not exactly match the theoretical mean and variance, especially if the number of random values (`n_runs`) is not very large. This is due to the law of large numbers, which states that as the size of a sample increases, the sample mean and variance will get closer to the population (theoretical) mean and variance.

# So, while the empirical and theoretical values should be close, they might not be exactly the same due to the inherent randomness in the data generation process. This is why it's useful to calculate and compare both the empirical and theoretical values: to confirm that the random values are being generated correctly and are representative of the intended Beta distribution.

# When you generate random numbers from a distribution (like the Beta distribution), these numbers should, on average, have the same properties as the distribution itself. This means that the average (mean) and spread (variance) of your random numbers should be close to the mean and variance of the Beta distribution.

# However, because you're generating random numbers, there's a chance element involved. This means that the mean and variance of your random numbers might not exactly match the mean and variance of the Beta distribution, especially if you're not generating a lot of numbers.

# So, when you calculate the mean and variance of your random numbers (the empirical mean and variance) and compare them to the mean and variance of the Beta distribution (the theoretical mean and variance), they should be close, but not necessarily exactly the same.

# This is why your colleague suggested generating some random numbers, calculating their mean and variance, and comparing these to the theoretical mean and variance. It's a way to check that your random numbers are behaving as they should.


# Copilot from Microsoft provided the following advice on Statistical Tests:


# For a more rigorous verification, you can consider statistical tests or other methods. Here are a few suggestions:
  
#  1. **Goodness-of-Fit Test**: This is a statistical hypothesis test to see how well your data fits a specified distribution. In R, you can use the `ks.test()` function for a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, which is a type of goodness-of-fit test. However, please note that the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test should be used with caution when the parameters are estimated from the data, as the test's performance can be significantly affected.

# ks_result <- ks.test(random_values, "pbeta", shape1 = alpha, shape2 = beta)
# print(ks_result)


# 2. **Quantile-Quantile Plot**: This is a graphical tool to help assess if a data set follows a particular distribution. The `qqplot()` function in R can be used to generate a QQ plot. If your data follows the specified distribution, the points in the QQ plot will approximately lie on the line y = x.

# qqplot(qbeta(ppoints(n_runs), shape1 = alpha, shape2 = beta), random_values)
# abline(0, 1, col = "red")

# 3. **Bootstrap Resampling**: This is a powerful statistical technique for estimating quantities about a population by averaging estimates from multiple small data samples. Specifically, you can use bootstrap resampling to construct confidence intervals for your parameters, which gives you a measure of their uncertainty.

# library(boot)
# boot_obj <- boot(random_values, function(data, indices) {
#   fit <- fitdistr(data[indices], "beta")
#   return(fit$estimate)
# }, R = 1000)
# boot.ci(boot_obj, type = "bca")

# Please note that these methods provide more rigorous ways to verify your distribution, but they also have their assumptions and limitations.


# Here's what you should look for in the results of each test:

# 1. **Goodness-of-Fit Test (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test)**: The result of the `ks.test()` function in R is a list that includes the test statistic (D) and the p-value. The null hypothesis of this test is that the data follows the specified distribution. If the p-value is less than your chosen significance level (commonly 0.05), you reject the null hypothesis and conclude that your data does not follow the specified distribution. If the p-value is greater than your chosen significance level, you do not reject the null hypothesis, which means your data may follow the specified distribution. However, as mentioned earlier, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test should be used with caution when the parameters are estimated from the data.

# 2. **Quantile-Quantile Plot**: In a QQ plot, if your data follows the specified distribution, the points should approximately lie on the line y = x. If the points deviate significantly from this line, it suggests that your data may not follow the specified distribution.

# 3. **Bootstrap Resampling**: The result of the `boot.ci()` function in R is a list that includes bootstrap confidence intervals for your parameters. These intervals give you a measure of the uncertainty around your parameter estimates. If the true parameter value lies within the confidence interval, it suggests that your parameter estimate is reasonable.

# Remember, these tests provide evidence, but not definitive proof, that your data follows the specified distribution. They should be used as part of a broader analysis that includes visual inspection of the data (e.g., histograms, density plots) and consideration of the underlying assumptions and characteristics of your data.

# A simpler method to verify the distribution of your data is to use descriptive statistics and visual inspection.

# **Descriptive Statistics**: You can use the `summary()` function in R to get a quick overview of your data. This will provide you with the minimum, 1st quartile, median, mean, 3rd quartile, and maximum of your data.

# summary(random_values)

# **Visual Inspection**: Plotting your data can give you a good sense of its distribution. You can use a histogram (as you've been doing), a density plot, or a boxplot.

# - **Density Plot**: This is similar to a histogram but can provide a smoother representation of the data distribution.

# plot(density(random_values), main = "Density Plot", xlab = "Values")

# - **Boxplot**: This provides a visual summary of the minimum, 1st quartile, median, 3rd quartile, and maximum of your data.

# boxplot(random_values, main = "Boxplot", ylab = "Values")

# Remember, these methods provide a high-level overview and might not detect subtle discrepancies between your data and the theoretical distribution. For a more rigorous verification, consider the methods I mentioned in the previous message.

# How would knowing the minimum, 1st quartile, median, mean, 3rd quartile, and maximum of my data help me?
 
# Knowing these descriptive statistics can provide a quick summary of your data and give you insights into its distribution:
   
#   1. **Minimum and Maximum**: These values provide the range of your data, which can help you understand the spread and limits of your data.
 
# 2. **1st Quartile (Q1) and 3rd Quartile (Q3)**: These are the 25th and 75th percentiles of your data, respectively. Half of your data falls within the interquartile range (IQR), which is the range between Q1 and Q3. The IQR can give you a sense of the spread of the middle half of your data.
 
# 3. **Median**: This is the middle value of your data when it's sorted in ascending order. If you have an odd number of observations, the median is the middle number. If you have an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. The median is a measure of central tendency that is not affected by outliers or extreme values.
 
# 4. **Mean**: This is the average of your data and is another measure of central tendency. Unlike the median, the mean is sensitive to outliers and extreme values.
 
# By comparing these statistics to the parameters of your theoretical distribution (e.g., the mean and variance of a beta distribution), you can get a sense of how well your data fits the distribution. For example, if the mean and variance of your data are close to the mean and variance of the theoretical distribution, this suggests that your data may follow the distribution.
 

# You can calculate the mean and variance of your data in R using the `mean()` and `var()` functions, respectively. Then, you can compare these values to the mean and variance of the theoretical distribution.

# For a beta distribution, the mean and variance are given by the following formulas:
  
#  - Mean: $$\mu = \frac{\alpha}{\alpha + \beta}$$
#  - Variance: $$\sigma^2 = \frac{\alpha\beta}{(\alpha + \beta)^2(\alpha + \beta + 1)}$$
  
#  Here's how you can do this in R:

# Calculate the mean and variance of your data
# data_mean <- mean(random_values)
# data_var <- var(random_values)

# Calculate the mean and variance of the theoretical distribution
# theoretical_mean <- alpha / (alpha + beta)
# theoretical_var <- (alpha * beta) / ((alpha + beta)^2 * (alpha + beta + 1))

# Compare the values
# print(paste("Data Mean: ", data_mean))
# print(paste("Theoretical Mean: ", theoretical_mean))
# print(paste("Data Variance: ", data_var))
# print(paste("Theoretical Variance: ", theoretical_var))

# This will print the mean and variance of your data and the theoretical distribution. If the values are close, it suggests that your data may follow the theoretical distribution.

# Remember, "close" is subjective and depends on the context. In some cases, a small difference might be significant, while in others, a larger difference might be acceptable. 



# You're correct that the mean and variance of the theoretical distribution are used to generate the random values, so you might expect them to be close to the mean and variance of your data. However, there are a few reasons why comparing these values can still be useful:
# 
# 1. **Verification of Assumptions**: The process of generating the random values assumes that your data follows a beta distribution. Comparing the mean and variance of your data to the mean and variance of the theoretical distribution helps verify this assumption. If the values are not close, it suggests that your data may not actually follow a beta distribution, despite the process used to generate the random values.
# 
# 2. **Effects of Randomness**: The `rbeta` function generates random values. Due to the inherent randomness, the mean and variance of the generated values can deviate from the mean and variance of the theoretical distribution, especially if the number of random values (`n_runs`) is not very large. Comparing these values can give you a sense of the extent of this deviation.
# 
# 3. **Parameter Estimation Errors**: The `alpha` and `beta` parameters are estimated from the mean and standard error. Any errors in these estimates will affect the mean and variance of the theoretical distribution, and hence the generated random values. Comparing the mean and variance of your data to the mean and variance of the theoretical distribution can help detect any such errors.
# 
# In summary, while the mean and variance of your data are expected to be close to the mean and variance of the theoretical distribution due to the process used to generate the random values, comparing these values can still provide useful insights and help verify the assumptions and parameters used in this process.

# can you explain to me why we compare the mean and variance of the data and the theoretical distribution?  If the values are close, it suggests that your data may follow the theoretical distribution. I would have thought that because I generate the se for the parameter from the mean as follows: P_OSD_SoC <- 0.17 max <- 0.22, min <- 0.12, mean <- P_OSD_SoC, se <- ((max)-(mean))/1.96, And generate the alpha and beta as follows: std.error <- se,  alpha.plus.beta <- mean*(1-mean)/(std.error^2)-1, ## alpha + beta (ab) alpha <- mean*alpha.plus.beta, ## alpha (a) beta <- alpha*(1-mean)/mean ## beta(b), to generate P_OSD_SoC = rbeta(n_runs, shape1 = alpha, shape2 = beta), that I wouldnt be able to compare the the mean and variance of your data to the mean and variance of the theoretical distribution, as they are in essence built from one another?


# Frequency Rather Than Density:

# The hist function in R can plot histograms using either frequencies or densities on the y-axis. The choice between the two depends on the freq argument: if freq=TRUE (the default), the histogram uses frequencies; if freq=FALSE, it uses densities.

# In the code above, I used freq = FALSE to normalize the histogram (so that the total area is 1), which is why the y-axis shows densities:

# In the code with  no freq argument, it defaults to freq = TRUE, and the y-axis shows frequencies:

# hist(random_values, main = "Histogram of Random Values", xlab = "Values")

# If we want the histogram to show frequencies instead of densities, we can modify the hist line in the above code to:
  
# hist(random_values, freq = TRUE, main = "Histogram with Beta Distribution", xlab = "Values")

# Frequency and density are two different ways of representing the same data in a histogram.

# Frequency: This is the simplest way to represent data in a histogram. Each bar in the histogram represents the number of data points that fall into a certain range of values (a bin). The height of the bar corresponds to the number of data points in that bin. So, if you have 10 data points between 0 and 1, the bar for that bin would have a height of 10.

# Density: This is a bit more complex. Instead of simply counting the number of data points in each bin, the density scales the counts so that the total area of the bars equals 1. This is useful when you want to compare two data sets that have different numbers of observations or when you want to fit a continuous probability density function (like the beta distribution) to the data.

# When you plot a histogram with densities (freq = FALSE), the y-axis shows densities instead of frequencies. The total area of the bars equals 1, and you can overlay a probability density function on the histogram.

# When you plot a histogram with frequencies (freq = TRUE), the y-axis shows frequencies. If you want to overlay a probability density function on this histogram, you need to scale the function to match the scale of the histogram. This is because the function is defined in terms of densities, not frequencies.

# The scale of the function depends on the number of observations and the binwidth of the histogram. Specifically, you would need to multiply the function by the number of observations and the binwidth to convert it from a density to a frequency. Here’s how you can do it:

# Calculate the binwidth
# binwidth = hist_data$breaks[2] - hist_data$breaks[1]

# Multiply the function by the number of observations and the binwidth
# curve(n_runs * binwidth * dbeta(x, shape1 = alpha, shape2 = beta), add = TRUE, col = "darkblue", lwd = 2)

# In this code, n_runs is the number of observations, binwidth is the width of each bin in the histogram, and dbeta(x, shape1 = alpha, shape2 = beta) is the beta density function.

# To  overlay the theoretical beta distribution curve on a histogram with frequencies, it's necessary  to scale the curve to match the scale of the histogram. This can be a bit more complex because the scale of the curve depends on the number of observations and the binwidth of the histogram.

# Plot a histogram of the random values

# hist(random_values, main = "Histogram of Random Values", xlab = "Values", col = "lightblue", border = "black")

# Calculate the binwidth
# binwidth = hist_data$breaks[2] - hist_data$breaks[1]

# Multiply the function by the number of observations and the binwidth
# curve(n_runs * binwidth * dbeta(x, shape1 = alpha, shape2 = beta), add = TRUE, col = "darkblue", lwd = 2)

# curve(dbeta(x, shape1 = alpha, shape2 = beta), add = TRUE, col = "red", lwd = 2)
# abline(v = mean(random_values), col = "green", lwd = 2, lty = 2) # Mean
# abline(v = min(random_values), col = "blue", lwd = 2, lty = 2) # Minimum
# abline(v = max(random_values), col = "blue", lwd = 2, lty = 2) # Maximum



# Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)



# I notice that in your code you add a density curve as follows: # Add density curve
#  lines(density(u_F), col = "darkblue", lwd = 2) which I assume is to overlay the I read that you can overlay the theoretical beta distribution curve on your histogram by using the curve function in R, I do this as follows: curve(dbeta(x, shape1 = alpha, shape2 = beta), add = TRUE, col = "yellow", lwd = 2) I notice that although the yellow line and the darkblue line are close to eachother, they are not exactly overlaid, I was wondering then what the difference is between the lines created, and why they are not exactly overlaid?


# Great observation! The difference between the two lines comes from what they represent:

#  1. `lines(density(u_F), col = "darkblue", lwd = 2)` is adding a **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)** to the plot. KDE is a non-parametric way to estimate the probability density function of a random variable. It is used when you don't know the distribution of the data or the parameters of that distribution. In this case, it's estimating the density based on the random values you generated (`u_F`).

# 2. `curve(dbeta(x, shape1 = alpha, shape2 = beta), add = TRUE, col = "yellow", lwd = 2)` is adding the **theoretical beta distribution** to the plot. This is the expected distribution based on the `alpha` and `beta` parameters you calculated. It's not based on the actual data (`u_F`), but on the theoretical distribution that the data should follow.

# The reason these two lines are not exactly overlaid is because the KDE is based on the actual data, which is a random sample and will have some variation, while the theoretical beta distribution represents the idealized version of the data. If you increase the number of random values you generate (`n_runs`), the KDE should get closer to the theoretical distribution as the sample better approximates the population.

# In summary, the dark blue line represents the estimated density of your actual data, while the yellow line represents the theoretical density you expect your data to have. They are not exactly the same because there is variation in your data, and the KDE is just an estimate. 

# Which is more informative and why?

# Both the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and the theoretical beta distribution provide valuable information, but in different ways:

#   1. **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)**: The KDE (the dark blue line in your plot) provides an empirical density estimate based on your actual data. It can be more informative when you want to understand the distribution of your observed data, especially when the underlying distribution is unknown or complex. The KDE does not assume any specific distribution and can capture patterns in the data that parametric methods might miss.

# 2. **Theoretical Beta Distribution**: The theoretical beta distribution (the yellow line in your plot) is based on the theoretical model you've assumed for your data. It can be more informative when you want to understand how your data compares to the theoretical expectations. If your data fits this distribution well, it can provide a succinct and mathematically tractable description of your data.

# In summary, the KDE is more data-driven and flexible, while the theoretical distribution is more model-driven and assumes a specific form for the data. Both can be informative depending on the context and the specific question you're trying to answer. 

# In your case, since you're generating data from a beta distribution, the theoretical beta distribution can serve as a useful check: if your data fits this distribution well, it suggests that your data generation process is working as expected. On the other hand, the KDE can help you visualize any unexpected patterns or anomalies in your data.
