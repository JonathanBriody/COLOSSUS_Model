# COLOSSUS_Model

**Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in Europe. COLOSSUS is an EU-funded H2020 project that aims to provide new and more effective ways to classify patients with a specific type of colorectal cancer (microsatellite stable RAS mutant metastatic colorectal cancer or MSS RAS mt mCRC) and to develop better treatments for them. Our ultimate goal is to deliver a personalised medicine approach for patients with MSS RAS mt mCRC that is currently not available.**

**  
**Our task per the DOA is: *"Task 7.4: Economic analyses of treatment based on new diagnostic tests vs SOC in MSS RAS mt CRC population [RCSI]"* per page 42 of COLOSSUS DoA Amend \#3 Dec 2020.This model represents an exploratory cost-effectiveness analysis of mCRC subtyping and associated treatment.
