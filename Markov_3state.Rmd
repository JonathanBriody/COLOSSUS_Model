# Parametric Survival Analysis:

It's a while since I did it, but I just remember that I think I used the return a data frame with ranges of parameters for which each strategy is optimal in "owsa_tornado" to see how much costs would need to reduce for the biosimilars to bevacizuma to be cost-effective, although I'd have to check that again in the below code and the following url if I wanted to be sure on how I did it: <https://rdrr.io/github/DARTH-git/dampack/man/owsa_tornado.html>

# Parallel computing
# Resampling can be significantly sped up by using parallel computing. This can be done in the following way:

# Define a cluster with the use_cluster() functions (i.e. use_cluster(4) to use 4 cores).
# Run the analysis as usual.
# To stop using parallel computing use the close_cluster() function.
# Results may vary depending on the machine, but we found speed gains to be quite limited beyond 4 cores.

# Here’s a breakdown of my cost calculations for each drug in the FOLFOX-4 regimen for Spain to get the total FOLFOX cost, considering that Leucovorin, 5-FU bolus, and 5-FU continuous infusion are provided twice in each cycle, once on day 1 and once on day 2 of the treatment cycle:
#   1.	Oxaliplatin:
#   o	Dosage: 85 mg/m²
# o	Patient’s BSA: 1.71 m²
# o	Cost/mg: €1.27
# o	Total dosage = Dosage per m² * BSA = 85 mg/m² * 1.71 m² = 145.35 mg
# o	Cost = Total dosage * Cost per mg = 145.35 mg * €1.27/mg = €184.59
# 2.	Leucovorin (provided twice):
#   o	Dosage: 200 mg/m²
# o	Patient’s BSA: 1.71 m²
# o	Cost/mg: €0.068
# o	Total dosage = Dosage per m² * BSA = 200 mg/m² * 1.71 m² = 342 mg
# o	Cost for one day = Total dosage * Cost per mg = 342 mg * €0.068/mg = €23.26
# o	Total cost for two days = Cost for one day * 2 = €23.26 * 2 = €46.52
# 3.	5-FU bolus (provided twice):
#   o	Dosage: 400 mg/m²
# o	Patient’s BSA: 1.71 m²
# o	Cost/mg: €0.008
# o	Total dosage = Dosage per m² * BSA = 400 mg/m² * 1.71 m² = 684 mg
# o	Cost for one day = Total dosage * Cost per mg = 684 mg * €0.008/mg = €5.47
# o	Total cost for two days = Cost for one day * 2 = €5.47 * 2 = €10.94
# 4.	5-FU continuous infusion (provided twice):
#   o	Dosage: 600 mg/m²
# o	Patient’s BSA: 1.71 m²
# o	Cost/mg: €0.008
# o	Total dosage = Dosage per m² * BSA = 600 mg/m² * 1.71 m² = 1026 mg
# o	Cost for one day = Total dosage * Cost per mg = 1026 mg * €0.008/mg = €8.21
# o	Total cost for two days = Cost for one day * 2 = €8.21 * 2 = €16.42
# Adding up all these costs gives the total cost for one cycle of FOLFOX-4 treatment:
#   Total cost = Cost of Oxaliplatin + Total cost of Leucovorin + Total cost of 5-FU bolus + Total cost of 5-FU continuous infusion = €184.59 + €46.52 + €10.94 + €16.42 = €258.47
# So, the total cost for one cycle of FOLFOX-4 treatment for a patient with a BSA of 1.71 m² would be approximately €258.47.
# Therefore, the total cost of one FOLFOX-4 cycle for a patient weighing 68 kg with a body surface area of 1.71 m² [BOTH WEIGHT AND BODY SURFACE AREA FIGURES TAKEN FROM THE RIVERA STUDY], considering the provided drug dosages and costs, and accounting for the two administrations of Leucovorin, 5-FU bolus, and 5-FU continuous infusion, would be approximately €258.47.
# Then I inflated these from 2013 to 2022 values using this website to get €297.97:  https://www.officialdata.org/spain/inflation/2013?endYear=2022&amount=258.47 
# I took these costs from the following publication by Rivera, as his original publication that I used in Table 1 for Folfiri compared Folfiri to FOLFOX-6 and so had costs for FOLFOX-6 rather than FOLFOX-4, which I study in this paper:

# 
# My calculation strategy is supported by the following document 6.1.2 Target Dose Banding or Drug Centred Dose Banding: 
#   “The patient’s dose is prescribed as per BSA and then rounded up or down to the nearest band e.g. doxorubicin 60mg/m2 for patient of 1.82 m 2 , the calculated dose is 109.2mg [THIS CALCULATION MATCHES MY STRATEGY - 1.82*60 = 109.2]. This would then fall into a pre-designated band e.g. 105mg to 114mg for which a dose of 110mg is given.”

# Lesleys Excel file on Irish costs also calculates the Dose/person (mg) as the Body area (mg/m2)* Dose/cycle (mg/m2).
# This is similarly confirmed by the following:
#   2.14 Dose-banding
# State whether or not dose-banding of drugs to ±5% is acceptable3. Indicate which drugs this applies to.
# Please note, rounding the calculated dose to the nearest dose it is possible to give is not dose-banding. (e.g. if oxaliplatin 85mg/m2and BSA 1.79m2; calculated dose = 152.15mg [which is what I calculated by applying the strategy above of multiplying the mg/m2 by the BSA m2 -> 85* 1.79 = 152.15], dose to give = 150mg; this is NOT dose-banding).

# The Rivera study uses the same administration cost for FOLFOX-6 and FOLFIRI, I suspect that this is because they both require only one day of administration, however, FOLFOX-4 (which we apply, rather than FOLFOX 6) requires two days of administration (because patients first receive 5FU as an injection into their line or cannula and then have the rest of the 5FU through a small pump that they carry on a belt or in a holder, once they have had all the 5FU, a nurse will disconnect the pump for them. This is usually done at the hospital, but sometimes a district nurse will do it.), therefore, I believe that for the FOLFOX portion of treatment (before patients progress into FOLFIRI) we should double the administration cost per cycle, to reflect that they experience the administration cost twice in each cycle when treated with FOLFOX-4 (Once on Day 1 and then again on Day 2 per the NCCP FOLFOX-4 Therapy-14 day: https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/5/cancer/profinfo/chemoprotocols/gastrointestinal/210.pdf compared with the NCCP FOLFOX-6 and FOLFIRI therapy guides: Modified FOLFOX-6 Therapy-14 day www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/5/cancer/profinfo/chemoprotocols/gastrointestinal/modified-folfox-6-therapy-14-day.pdf and FOLFIRI Therapy-14 day https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/5/cancer/profinfo/chemoprotocols/gastrointestinal/227-folfiri-therapy-14-day.pdf)

# Rivera, Fernando, et al. "Cost-effectiveness analysis in the Spanish setting of the PEAK trial of panitumumab plus mFOLFOX6 compared with bevacizumab plus mFOLFOX6 for first-line treatment of patients with wild-type RAS metastatic colorectal cancer." Journal of Medical Economics 20.6 (2017): 574-584. – costs in this study were expressed in 2015 euro values.
# Although, actually, the above only includes a 1 day administration cost, even though patients on FOLFOX are on 46h continuous IV and thus would have to return to the hospital to have their pump removed, just like FOLFOX 4, actually the only extra thing from FOLFOX 4 seems to be the additional IV bolus study doesn’t seem to include.
# Actually, Rivera provide an administration cost per cycle of 267.65 which they apply to FOLFIRI or FOLFOX6 regardless of the fact that FOLFOX6 requires the patient to come in and get treatment with a bolus on days 1 and 2 a 46 h intravenous infusion administered over 46h on day 2. I guess what I'm getting at, is that they used the same administration cost per cycle for FOLFOX6 and FOLFIRI even though FOLFIRI only needed you to come in for one day and FOLFOX6 required you to come in for 2 (just like FOLFOX4) in our study. This may be due to the fact that in the other Rivera study the FOLFOX-4 visit was only another 10 minutes with the nurse on the second day so maybe they didnt feel there was a need to include additional cost for those ten minutes. In this respect we probably don't need to change our FOLFOX cost to reflect the second day, just like they didnt.
# The fact that they use the same chemotherapy administration cost per cycle for FOLFOX and FOLFIRI (even though FOLFOX6 has a second day while FOLFIRI doesn’t) indicates I only need to include a singular administration for Ireland and for Germany cost as well. It also means that I can use the same administration cost from the Rivera study for FOLFOX and FOLFIRI in my own study for Spain
# FOLFIRI was 118.62 in 2015 values in Rivera, Fernando, et al.

# Here's how to remove the BVZ rows from the excel files we have: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/excel/deleting-rows-that-contain-specific-content/m-p/2084473

# The data needs to be set up to include a column for the time (in the example this is time in years) and a status indicator whether the time corresponds to an event, i.e. progression (status = 1), or to the last time of follow up, i.e. censoring (status = 0),

# "What is Censoring? Censoring in a study is when there is incomplete information about a study participant, observation or value of a measurement. In clinical trials, it's when the event doesn't happen while the subject is being monitored or because they drop out of the trial." - https://www.statisticshowto.com/censoring/#:~:text=What%20is%20Censoring%3F,drop%20out%20of%20the%20trial.

# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis#:~:text=or%20q%20%3D%200.99.-,Censoring,is%20common%20in%20survival%20analysis.

# At the bottom of the parametric survival code I think about how time from individual patient data may be changed to match the time of our cycles.

# I think the digitiser will give me the time in the context of the survival curves I am digitising, i.e., time in weeks, or time in months or time in years.

# Then I will have to set-up my time accordingly in the R code so that my cycle length is at the same level as the individual patient data.

# That is, in Koen's example:

# C:\Users\Jonathan\OneDrive - Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland\COLOSSUS\R Code\Parametric Survival Analysis\ISPOR WEBINAR Health Economic Modelling in R\ISPOR_webinar_R-master

# the data includes a column for the time (in years)
# t_cycle <- 1/4      # cycle length of 3 months (in years)                                # n_cycle <- 60       # number of cycles (total runtime 15 years)
  

# So I would have my colum for time, in the [TIME] the graph I was digitising used.
# Then I would create my cycle length of X weeks (in [TIME] the graph I was digitising used)
# Then I would have my number of cycles that would add up to give me a total runtime of how long I want to run the model for.
# So, above Koen wanted to run the model for 15 years, but his cycles were in 3 months, or each cycle was a quarter of a year, so 60 quarters, or 60 3 month cycles, is 15 years.

#03 Parametric Survival Analysis Model Plan

# We will implement a Markov model with time-dependent transition probabilities, via a parametric survival model fitted to some individual patient data for the time-to-progression (TTP) and time-to-death (TTD) for standard of care.

# A hazard ratio for the new intervention therapy vs. the standard of care will then be applied to obtain transition probabilities for the new experimental strategy.

# Let's first review the survival curves and see if they match the study:

# Do the Weibull probabilities match the probabilities created directly by the Kaplan-Meier:

# I do this first for TTP:

# summary(survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ 1, data = df_TTP), times = 0)
# 
# summary(survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ 1, data = df_TTP), times = 14)

# Then, I calculate the probability of staying in the PFS state, which is what the above gives me. To do this, I create all the other probabilities as zero because I just want to look at whats going on with my Weibull probabilities for the PFS curve, I also put it in the first slot, as the way it works is that it needs to be multiplied by 1, and m_M_SoC has a cohort trace with 1 in in the first slot, ready to be matrix multiplied by m_P_SoC with it's probabilities. It's 1- because the probabilities created above from the PFS curve are probabilities of staying in PFS, not the probabilities of moving from PFS to OS.

# m_P_SoC["PFS", "PFS",]<- (1 -p_PFSOS_SoC)
# m_P_SoC["PFS", "OS",]<- 0

# 
# 
# # Setting the transition probabilities from Dead
# m_P_SoC["Dead", "Dead", ] <- 0

# So here I once again create the Markov cohort trace by looping over all cycles
# - note that the trace can easily be obtained using matrix multiplications
# - note that now the right probabilities for the cycle need to be selected, like I explained above. (this is all just the comments written from where I actually do the analysis).
# for(i_cycle in 1:(n_cycle-1)) {
#   m_M_SoC[i_cycle + 1, ] <- m_M_SoC[i_cycle, ] %*% m_P_SoC[ , , i_cycle]

# head(m_M_SoC)  # print the first few lines of the matrix for standard of care (m_M_SoC)
# head(m_M_Exp)  # print the first few lines of the matrix for experimental treatment(m_M_Exp)

# looking at the cohort trace -> m_M_SoC, you see that the proportions in the PFS state from 100 are basically identical to the probabilities of being in those states created from the Kaplan Meier, again starting from 100% of people under study, thus, the Weibull probabilities created match the Kaplan-Meier.

# Here, like above, I put the p_PFSD_SoC bit into the first part of the probability matrix, even though it concerns people going from first line treatment or PFS to dead, because it needs to be multiplied by the 1 that exists in the cohort:

# m_M_SoC

# This also answers the question of how exactly probabilities are created in my code, the m_P_SoC is something that, when multiplied by 1, (when at the start 100% of our cohort are in the PFS state) gives us the first probability from that 100%, and the next part or row of that m_P_SoC probability is then multiplied by the proportion who are in the different states in the next row for the cohort (given their movements last time having been multiplied by m_P_SoC) which gives us the second probability multiplied by the proportion of that 1 (or 100%) in each state, and so on, and so forth, for each wave.





# Median Survival Time:

# We want to calculate the median survival time WITH bevacizumab, i.e., the median PFS and OS with bev to compare it to the median PFS and OS in other studies with bevacizumab but without our chromosomal instability subtypes, so that we can make comparisons.

# So, we make 2 new excel files of data and store them in the same folder from the Angiopredict data Ian gave us and which we used to make our TTP and TTD data.

#03 Input model parameters
#  This is just a block of text reminding myself why ordering, V_names_states v_tc_SoC, v_tc_Exp,  v_tu_SoC and v_tu_Exp matters, feel free to skip over this:

# The ordering of V_names_states has an influence on the tornado diagram and the reported cost-effectiveness results.

# So, I need to ensure I correctly order V_names_states all the way through from the start.

# m_P_Exp and m_P_SoC both use v_names_states to set up the names of the rows and columns of their matrices. 

# As does m_M_SoC and m_M_Exp.

# Then m_M_SoC and  m_M_Exp use the row column names to fill in the 100% of the cohort (or 1) in PFS and the 0% of the cohort in OS and DEAD in wave 1. m_P_Exp and m_P_SoC also both use the row and column names to fill in the transition probabilities between PFS and OS, etc.,

# Then m_M_SoC and m_M_Exp are matrix multiplied by m_P_Exp and m_P_SoC:

# for(i_cycle in 1:(n_cycle-1)) {
#  m_M_SoC[i_cycle + 1, ] <- m_M_SoC[i_cycle, ] %*% m_P_SoC[ , , i_cycle]
#  m_M_Exp[i_cycle + 1, ] <- m_M_Exp[i_cycle, ] %*% m_P_Exp[ , , i_cycle]
# }

# The way this matrix multiplication works is that the value in box 1 for m_M_SoC is multiplied by the value in box 1 for m_P_SoC and so on. If box 1 for m_M_SoC and m_P_SoC is the 1 (i.e. 100% of people in the PFS state when this all starts), multiplied by the PFS state probabilities, i.e., the probability of going from the PFS state into other states like so:

#          PFS       AE1       AE2       AE3          OS        Dead

# PFS  0.974925 0.0194985 0.0194985 0.0194985 0.005074995 0.020000000

# (Ignore the AE health states, this layout is a holdover from when AE's were going to have their own health states in the Markov model).

# Then things will multiply correctly and we're multiplying PFS transition probabilities by the 100% of the cohort in the PFS state. 

# Even, if ordering v_names_states  <- c("PFS", "AE1", "AE2", "AE3", "OS", "Dead")   is not in the order as above, i.e., v_names_states  <- c("OS", "AE1", "AE2", "AE3", "PFS", "Dead") , then the m_M_SoC will have 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, because everyone still starts in the PFS state, and m_P_SoC will have  "OS", "AE1", "AE2", "AE3", "PFS", "Dead", with the right probabilities put in the right spots, so when you matrix multiply it things will multiply out fine.

# However, this is not the case for ordering costs and utilities:

# v_tc_SoC <- m_M_SoC %*% c(c_F_SoC, c_AE1, c_AE2, c_AE3, c_P, c_D)
# v_tc_Exp <- m_M_Exp %*% c(c_F_Exp, c_AE1, c_AE2, c_AE3, c_P, c_D)
# v_tu_SoC <- m_M_SoC %*% c(u_F, u_AE1, u_AE2, u_AE3, u_P, u_D)
# v_tu_Exp <- m_M_Exp %*% c(u_F, u_AE1, u_AE2, u_AE3, u_P, u_D)

# As you can see, in both cases the ordering is set manually by how we enter things in the concatenated brackets, so in the case above where ordering v_names_states  <- c("PFS", "AE1", "AE2", "AE3", "OS", "Dead") is ordered differently, i.e., v_names_states  <- c("OS", "AE1", "AE2", "AE3", "PFS", "Dead") when we matrix multiply costs and utilities by m_M_SoC  and m_M_Exp above we will be multiplying the utility of being in the progression free state u_F by the matrix of individuals in the OS state, which will clearly be a smaller number of individuals in the first few waves, and multiplying the utility of the OS state (u_P) by the larger number of individuals actually in the PFS state <- c("OS", "AE1", "AE2", "AE3", "PFS", "Dead"). We'll be doing the same thing with costs. What this will mean is more people getting the OS costs and OS utility and fewer people getting the PFS costs and the PFS utility, which will in turn have consequences for the cost-effectiveness analysis results with more OS costs and more OS utility being considered in the equation that compares costs and utilities.

# I've confirmed all of the things I say about by changing the ordering first of v_names_states, and then of the cost and utility concatenations. Changing the ordering of v_names_states did nothing to the CEA results or Tornado diagram provided I changed the ordering of utilities and costs to match this, changing the ordering of utilities and costs changed both unless I changed them to be in an order that matched the changed ordering of v_names_states.
```

```{r}
## General setup

# Here, I think about how time from individual patient data may be changed to match the time of our cycles.

# I think the digitiser (if I am using one) will give me the time in the context of the survival curves I am digitising, i.e., time in weeks, or time in months or time in years. Otherwise if I get the data directly from Ian it will also have time in the context of the existing survival curves.

# Then I will have to set-up my time accordingly in the R code so that my cycle length is at the same level as the individual patient data.

# That is, in Koen's example:

# C:\Users\Jonathan\OneDrive - Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland\COLOSSUS\R Code\Parametric Survival Analysis\ISPOR WEBINAR Health Economic Modelling in R\ISPOR_webinar_R-master

# the data includes a column for the time (in years)
# t_cycle <- 1/4      # cycle length of 3 months (in years)                                # n_cycle <- 60       # number of cycles (total runtime 15 years)
  

# So I would have my colum for time, in the [TIME] the graph I was digitising/getting data from used.
# Then I would create my cycle length of X weeks (in [TIME] the graph I was digitising used)
# Then I would have my number of cycles that would add up to give me a total runtime of how long I want to run the model for.
# So, above Koen wanted to run the model for 15 years, but his cycles were in 3 months, or each cycle was a quarter of a year, so 60 quarters, or 60 3 month cycles, is 15 years.

# REALISE HERE THEAT P_PD ISNT THE PROBABILITY OF PROGRESSION TO DEAD, BUT OF PFS TO DEAD, OF FIRST LINE TO DEAD, BECAUSE OUR ANGIOPREDICT CURVES ONLY EVER DESCRIBE FIRST LINE TREATMENT, BE THAT FIRST LINE SOC TREATMENT OR FIRST LINE EXP TREATMENT.

# Here we define all our model parameters, so that we can call on these parameters later during our model:

t_cycle <- 14      # cycle length of 2 weeks (in [[days]] - this is assuming the survival curves I am digitising will be in [[days]] if they are in another period I will have to represent my cycle length in that period instead).                                  
n_cycle        <- 143                            
# We set the number of cycles to 143 to reflect 2,000 days from the Angiopredict study (5 Years, 5 Months, 3 Weeks, 1 Day) broken down into fortnightly cycles
v_names_cycles  <- paste("cycle", 0:n_cycle)    
# So here, we just name each cycle by the cycle its on, going from 0 up to the number of cycles there are, here 143
v_names_states  <- c("PFS", "OS", "Dead")  
# These are the health states in our model, PFS, OS, Death.
n_states        <- length(v_names_states)        
# We're just taking the number of health states from the number of names we came up with, i.e. the number of names to reflect the number of health states 

# Strategy names
v_names_strats     <- c("Standard of Care",         
                     "Experimental Treatment")
               # store the strategy names

# TRANSITION PROBABILITIES: Time-To-Transition - TTP:


# Time-dependent transition probabilities are obtained in four steps
# 1) Defining the cycle times
# 2) Obtaining the event-free (i.e. survival) probabilities for the cycle times for SoC
# 3) Obtaining the event-free (i.e. survival) probabilities for the cycle times for Exp based on a hazard ratio
# 4) Obtaining the time-dependent transition probabilities from the event-free (i.e. survival) probabilities

# 1) Defining the cycle times
(t <- seq(from = 0, by = t_cycle, length.out = n_cycle + 1))

# Here we're saying, at each cycle how many of the time periods our individual patient data is measured at have passed? Here our individual patient data is in days, so we have 0 in cycle 0, 14 (or two weeks) in cycle 1, and so on.

# Having established that allows us to obtain the transition probabilities for the time we are interested in for our cycles from this different period individual patient data, so where the individual patient data is in days and our cycles are in fortnight or half months, this allows us to obtain transition probabilities for these fortnights.

# 2) Obtaining the event-free (i.e. survival) probabilities for the cycle times for SoC
# S_FP_SoC - survival of progression free to progression, i.e. not going to progression, i.e. staying in progression free.
# Note that the coefficients [that we took from flexsurvreg earlier] need to be transformed to obtain the parameters that the base R function uses


S_FP_SoC <- pweibull(
  q     = t, 
  shape = exp(coef_weibull_shape_SoC),

# [3,] 1.0 0.9770661
# [4,] 1.5 0.9458256
# [5,] 2.0 0.9015175
# [6,] 2.5 0.8454597


# Having the above header shows that this is probability for surviving in the F->P state, i.e., staying in this state, because you can see in time 0 100% of people are in this state, meaning 100% of people hadnt progressed and were in PFS, if this was instead about the progressed state (i.e. OS), there should be no-one in this state when the model starts, as everyone starts in the PFS state, and it takes a while for people to reach the OS state.


# 3) Obtaining the event-free (i.e. survival) probabilities for the cycle times for Experimental treatment (aka the novel therapy) based on a hazard ratio.
# So here we basically have a hazard ratio for the novel therapy that says you do X much better under the novel therapy than under standard of care, and we want to apply it to standard of care from our individual patient data to see how much improved things would be under the novel therapy.
# (NB - if we ultimately decide not to use a hazard ratio, I could probably just create my transition probabilities for the experimental therapy from individual patient data that I have digitised from patients under this novel therapy).
# Here our hazard ratio is 0.68, I can change that hazard ratio if I need to in the future.
# - note that S(t) = exp(-H(t)) and, hence, H(t) = -ln(S(t))
# that is, the survival function is the expoential of the negative hazard function, per:
# https://faculty.washington.edu/yenchic/18W_425/Lec5_survival.pdf
# and: 
# https://web.stanford.edu/~lutian/coursepdf/unit1.pdf
# Also saved here: C:\Users\Jonathan\OneDrive - Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland\COLOSSUS\R Code\Parametric Survival Analysis\flexsurv
# And to multiply by the hazard ratio it's necessary to convert the survivor function into the hazard function, multiply by the hazard ratio, and then convert back to the survivor function, and then these survivor functions are used for the probabilities.

    # I want to vary my probabilities for the one-way sensitivity analysis, particularly for the tornado       plot of the deterministic sensitivity analysis. 
    
    # The problem here is that df_params_OWSA doesnt like the fact that a different probability for each       cycle (from the time-dependent transition probabilities) gives a large number of rows (say if there were 60 cycles,      two treatment strategies and a probability for each cycle we would see 122 rows). It wants the same number of       rows as      there are probabilities, i.e., it would prefer a probability of say 0.50 and then a max and a      min     around that.
    
    # To address this, I think I can apply this mean, max and min to the hazard ratios instead, knowing        that when run_owsa_det is run in the sensitivity analysis it calls the "oncologySemiMarkov_function" function to run and in this        function the hazard ratios generate the survivor function, and then these survivor functions are used      to generate the probabilities (which will be cycle dependent).
    
    # This is fine for the hazard ratio for the experimental strategy, I can just take:
    
    # HR_FP_Exp as my mean, and:
    
    # Minimum_HR_FP_Exp <- HR_FP_Exp - 0.20*HR_FP_Exp
    # Maximum_HR_FP_Exp <- HR_FP_Exp + 0.20*HR_FP_Exp
    
    # For min and max.
    
# For standard of care there was no hazard ratio, because we took these values from the survival curves     directly, and didnt vary them by a hazard ratio, like we do above.
    
# To address this, I create a hazard ratio that is exactly one.
    
    # hazard ratio

    # A measure of how often a particular event happens in one group compared to how often it happens in       another group, over time. In cancer research, hazard ratios are often used in clinical trials to           measure survival at any point in time in a group of patients who have been given a specific treatment      compared to a control group given another treatment or a placebo. A hazard ratio of one means that         there is no difference in survival between the two groups. A hazard ratio of greater than one or less      than one means that survival was better in one of the groups. https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/hazard-ratio

    # Thus, I can have a hazard ratio where the baseline value of it gives you the survival curves, and        thus the probabilities, from the actual survival curves we are drawing from, and where the min and max     will be 1 +/- 0.20, which will give us probabilities that are 20% higher or lower than the probabilities from the actual survival curves that we are drawing from in the parametric survival analysis to get transitions under standard of care.
    
    # To do this, I just have to add a hazard ratio to the code that creates the transition probabilities      under standard of care as below, then I can add that hazard ratio, and it's max and min, to the            deterministic sensitivity analysis and vary all the probabilities by 20%.
        

    # So here we basically have a hazard ratio that is equal to 1, so it leaves things unchanged for           patients, and we want to apply it to standard of care from our individual patient data to leave things     unchanged in this function, but allow things to change in the sensitivity analysis lower down.
      
    # Here our hazard ratio is 1, things are unchanged.

# So, first we create our hazard ratio == 1
HR_FP_SoC <- 1

# (I'm creating the below as new parameters, i.e. putting "nu" infront of them, in case keeping the name the same causes a problem for when I want to use them in the deterministic sensivity analysis, i.e., if I generate a parameter from itself - say var_name = var_name exactly, then there may be some way in which R handles code that won't let this work, or will take one parameter before the other, or something and stop the model from executing correctly).

# Then, we create our hazard function for SoC:
NU_S_FP_SoC <- S_FP_SoC
NU_H_FP_SoC  <- -log(NU_S_FP_SoC)
# Then, we multiply this hazard function by our hazard ratio, which is just 1, but which gives us the      opportunity to apply a hazard ratio to standard of care in our code and thus to have a hazard ratio for     standard of care for our one way deterministic sensitivity analysis and tornado diagram lower down in our code:

# TRANSITION PROBABILITIES: Time-To-Dead TTD

# [[I basically re-tread what I did for TTP so feel free just to skim this]]

# REALISE HERE THEAT P_PD ISNT THE PROBABILITY OF PROGRESSION TO DEAD, BUT OF PFS TO DEAD, OF FIRST LINE TO DEAD, BECAUSE OUR ANGIOPREDICT CURVES ONLY EVER DESCRIBE FIRST LINE TREATMENT, BE THAT FIRST LINE SOC TREATMENT OR FIRST LINE EXP TREATMENT.


# To make sure that my PFS probabilities only reflect going from PFS to progression, I create the probability of going from PFS to DEAD under standard of care and the experimental, and decrease my PFS to progression probability created above by the probability of going into the dead state, such that I am only capturing people going into progression, and not people going into death as well.

# So, first I create the transition probabilities of progression free into dead for SoC and Exp, then I convert all the probabilities (i.e. those for PFS and those for OS) into rates, minus them from eachother, turn them back into probabilities, and make sure none are negative (and where they are replace these with 0).

# Actually, I don't do the rates thing, I just I take all the probabilities (i.e. those for PFS and those for OS), minus them from eachother.

# (ACTUALLY, I'm leaving this here for now, but ultimately I decided against doing any of the above, given a comment made by Joshua in email).



# Time-dependent transition probabilities are obtained in four steps
# 1) Defining the cycle times [we already did this above]
# 2) Obtaining the event-free (i.e. overall survival) probabilities for the cycle times for SoC
# 3) Obtaining the event-free (i.e. overall survival) probabilities for the cycle times for Exp based on a hazard ratio
# 4) Obtaining the time-dependent transition probabilities from the event-free (i.e. overall survival) probabilities

# 1) Defining the cycle times

# Having the above header shows that this is probability for surviving in the PFS->D state, i.e., staying in this state, because you should see in time 0 0% of people are in this state, meaning 100% of people hadnt gone into the dead state and were in PFS, which make sense in this model, the model starts with everyone in PFS, no-one starts the model in dead, and it takes a while for people to reach the dead state.


# 3) Obtaining the event-free (i.e. overall survival) probabilities for the cycle times for Experimental treatment (aka the novel therapy) based on a hazard ratio.
# So here we basically have a hazard ratio for the novel therapy that says you do X much better under the novel therapy than under standard of care, and we want to apply it to standard of care from our individual patient data to see how much improved things would be under the novel therapy.

# Here our hazard ratio is 0.65, I can change that hazard ratio if necessary.
# - note that S(t) = exp(-H(t)) and, hence, H(t) = -ln(S(t))
# that is, the survival function is the expoential of the negative hazard function, per:
# https://faculty.washington.edu/yenchic/18W_425/Lec5_survival.pdf
# and: 
# https://web.stanford.edu/~lutian/coursepdf/unit1.pdf
# Also saved here: C:\Users\Jonathan\OneDrive - Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland\COLOSSUS\R Code\Parametric Survival Analysis\flexsurv
# And to multiply by the hazard ratio it's necessary to convert the survivor function into the hazard function, multiply by the hazard ratio, and then convert back to the survivor function, and then these survivor functions are used for the probabilities.

# I want to vary my probabilities for the one-way sensitivity analysis, particularly for the tornado       plot of the deterministic sensitivity analysis. 

# The problem here is that df_params_OWSA doesnt like the fact that a different probability for each       cycle (from the time-dependent transition probabilities) gives many rows (say there are 60 cycles,      two treatment strategies and a probability for each cycle would give 122 rows). It wants the same number of       rows as      there are probabilities, i.e., it would prefer a probability of say 0.50 and then a max and a      min     around that.

# To address this, I think I can apply this mean, max and min to the hazard ratios instead, knowing        that when run_owsa_det is run in the sensitivity analysis it calls this function to run and in this        function the hazard ratios generate the survivor function, and then these survivor functions are used      to generate the probabilities (which will be cycle dependent).

# This is fine for the hazard ratio for the experimental strategy, I can just take:

# HR_PD_Exp as my mean, and:

# Minimum_HR_PD_Exp <- HR_PD_Exp - 0.20*HR_PD_Exp
# Maximum_HR_PD_Exp <- HR_PD_Exp + 0.20*HR_PD_Exp

# For min and max.

# For standard of care there was no hazard ratio, because we took these values from the survival curves     directly, and didnt vary them by a hazard ratio, like we do above.

# To address this, I create a hazard ratio that is exactly one.

# hazard ratio

# A measure of how often a particular event happens in one group compared to how often it happens in       another group, over time. In cancer research, hazard ratios are often used in clinical trials to           measure survival at any point in time in a group of patients who have been given a specific treatment      compared to a control group given another treatment or a placebo. A hazard ratio of one means that         there is no difference in survival between the two groups. A hazard ratio of greater than one or less      than one means that survival was better in one of the groups. https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/hazard-ratio

# Thus, I can have a hazard ratio where the baseline value of it gives you the survival curves, and        thus the probabilities, from the actual survival curves we are drawing from, and where the min and max     will be 1 +/- 0.20, which will give us probabilities that are 20% higher or lower than the probabilities from the actual survival curves that we are drawing from in the parametric survival analysis to get transitions under standard of care.

# To do this, I just have to add a hazard ratio to the code that creates the transition probabilities      under standard of care as below, then I can add that hazard ratio, and it's max and min, to the            deterministic sensitivity analysis and vary all the probabilities by 20%.


# So here we basically have a hazard ratio that is equal to 1, so it leaves things unchanged for           patients, and we want to apply it to standard of care from our individual patient data to leave things     unchanged in this function, but allow things to change in the sensitivity analysis.

# Here our hazard ratio is 1, things are unchanged.

# So, first we create our hazard ratio == 1
HR_PD_SoC <- 1

# (I'm creating the below as new parameters, i.e. putting "nu" infront of them, in case keeping the name the same causes a problem for when I want to use them in the deterministic sensivity analysis, i.e., if I generate a parameter from itself - say var_name = var_name exactly, then there may be some way in which R handles code that won't let this work, or will take one parameter before the other, or something and stop the model from executing correctly).

# Then, we create our hazard function for SoC:
NU_S_PD_SoC <- S_PD_SoC
NU_H_PD_SoC  <- -log(NU_S_PD_SoC)
# Then, we multiply this hazard function by our hazard ratio, which is just 1, but which gives us the      opportunity to apply a hazard ratio to standard of care in our code and thus to have a hazard ratio for     standard of care for our one way deterministic sensitivity analysis and tornado diagram.
NUnu_H_PD_SoC  <- NU_H_PD_SoC * HR_PD_SoC

}

# round(p_PFSD_SoC, digits=2)
# round(p_PFSD_Exp, digits=2)
# If I wanted to round I could apply the above, but my code already rounds my numbers.

# Then we generate our transition probability under standard of care and under the experimental treatement using survival functions that havent and have had the hazard ratio from above applied to them, respectively. [If we decide not to apply a hazard ratio for the experimental strategy going from progression to dead then neither may have a hazard ratio applied to them].

And then we can keep the first line treatment to death probabilities we've created from the OS curves to capture people who have left first line treatment to transition into death rather than second line treatment.

To do so, first convert the probability of dying from healthy, p_HD , to a rate; then multiply this rate by the appropriate hazard ratio; finally, convert this rate back to a probability. Recall that you can convert between rates and probabilities using the following formulas: r = − log(1 − p) and p = 1 − e ( − rt ) .

## Health State Values (AKA State rewards)
# Costs and utilities  
# Basically the outcomes we are interested in coming out of this model, so we'll look at the cohorts costs over the time horizon and the quality adjusted life years in our cohort over this time horizon.

# Costs

# The costs are a particularly important part of the model, because these are the only things that differ between countries. We make the assumption, per the literature and pragmatically (because we are examining 3 different countries at once in this model), that utilities and incidence of adverse events are generalisable across countries.

# So, the best way to deal with needing 3 different sets of costs, one for each country, is likely to create a concatanated vector, where the first set of entries refers to Ireland, the second set refers to Germany and the third set refers to Spain, then when we are building a diagram or doing some analysis in the model we can have c_F_SoC[1], c_F_Exp[1] and c_P[1], referring to Ireland, and so on for Spain[3] and Germany[2].

# Ireland[1]
# Germany[2]
#Spain[3]



# I pursued this avenue and it was too complicated, so instead I just define the parameters that vary in the Rmarkdown file that calls this file.

# Basically, what I do is set these parameters equal to the costs for the country I am interested in, in the Markdown file that calls this file, and then run this current file with the parameter names from the Rmarkdown file subbed in for costs and other country-specific values. Then I repeat this for each country I am interested in.

# So, you could produce your survival curve and compare it to curves from trials, etc., to calibrate your model.

# For calibration purposes, you want to make sure that your model is outputting something that's comparable to the publications out there on actual data on the same type of patients.

# Part of being comparable to the real world is that if there is a censoring process in actual patient data, then you could incorporate this process into the model to reflect that in your model and to ensure that your own model is comparable to the existing models which may be losing people due to censoring, etc., and which you'll then need to incorporate into your model to be comparable.

# calculate expected costs by multiplying cohort trace with the cost vector for the different health states

# Basically, you take the cohort trace over time for each strategy [m_M_SoC] and multiply this by a vector of our costs for each state: [c(c_H, c_S, c_D)] -> So, basically the number of people in each state at each cycle multiplied by the cost of being in that state [cost of healthy, cost of sick and cost of dead] for each strategy that we look at (standard of care, experimental).

# Bear in mind we are doing matrix multiplication [%*%], because what this does is for each cycle [row in the matrix], take the vector of costs, and multiply it by the distribution in that cycle [breakdown of proportions in the states in that row] and add it all together, to get the total costs for that cycle [row]. This gives us a vector of the costs accrued in this cohort of individuals ending up in these different states for each cycle on a per person basis, because it's a cohort distribution (it always sums to 1).

# So, in cycle 1 everyone is in the PFS state, so they only incur the PFS cost, as more and more time passes and more and more people get sick, the costs increases due to more people being in the OS state, but over time this falls again as more and more people go into the dead state, which has no costs as we don't treat corpses.

# In that study events were 5 days, so we can say that these are the decreases in utility for 5 days of these adverse events.

# THE BELOW WOULD WORK IF THE ORIGINAL STUDY REPORTED DECREASES FOR 14 DAYS AND WE WANTED TO APPLY THEM TO 7 DAYS, BUT THE ORIGINAL STUDY REPORTS THE DECREASE FOR 5 DAYS OF TOXICITY AND THUS THIS IS TOO FAR IN TERMS OF CALCULATIONS:





# 
# #daily_utility <- u_F/14
# 
# daily_discount_AE_1 <- AE1_DisUtil/14 # I break that disutility into a daily utility so I can apply it just for a portion of my cycle, as the adverse events only last for 7 days.
# daily_discount_AE_2  <- AE2_DisUtil/14 
# daily_discount_AE_3  <- AE3_DisUtil/14 
# 
# 
# AE1_discounted_daily_utility <- daily_discount_AE_1  * 5  # Creating 5 days of the disutility from 1 day because the adverse event lasts for 5 days each time they occur in a 14 day cycle.

# AE3_discounted_daily_utility <- daily_discount_AE_3  * 5 
# 
# # # ignore this, I now take a different approach: By multiplying by (1-the percent), we are discounting by that percentage.
# # That is, say you wanted to take 10% of 10 -> 10*(1-0.10) = 10*(0.90) = 9, discounting 10 by 10% gives you 9, i.e., 10% of 10 euro is 9 euro.

# # Above I had also included 7 days of normal utility when generating the u_AE's - now I realise that was wrong and have consequently updated the below.

# This is how this code works to apply disutilities, it's the probability of the event happening and taking the disutility amount away from the utility you started with, for illustration purposes I set the utility you started with to 100 and the discount to 10% and the probability of the adverse event happening to 100%, so you should 100% lose 10% of your utility, and there are three adverse events following this rule, so you should 100% lose 10% of your baseline utility for each adverse event, so you should lose 30% of your baseline utility. The way this is coded, it basically figures out what x% of your baseline utility is, then it takes that number away from the baseline utility if that adverse event happens, so 10% of 100 is 10, so if that adverse event happens you take away 100-10 giving you 90, if all 3 adverse events happen, it's 100-10-10-10 giving you 70. That's why you have to be careful with your disutilities, because, if all three happen and they were 50%, 50% and 50% you could have a situation of 100-50-50-50, which would mean your utility would be -50, which isnt possible in utilities, as they are bounded by 1 and 0, so you might have to write a piece of code that checks if it is below 0, and when it is to set it == 0 instead.

# In my situation that can't happen, as my disutilities are 0.45+0.19+0.36 which add up to 1, so the very most that could be taken from my baseline utility is 100% of it's value, leaving it at 0 exactly, and my probabilities of each event are quite low, significantly decreasing the likelihood of all three occurring:

# I actually take a different strategy, as below:






# I want to add a one-off cost to the experimental arm of the cost of subtyping individuals with the subtype we are studying. That is, the cost of the test. The cost of the test itself is 200 Euro, but apparently it is necessary to test 2 people to find 1 with our subtype, so I would double this to 400 Euro. Then I would apply it as a one-off cost in the experimental arm. It's a one-off as they are only tested once, then they are treated. I also would like to apply this in the first cycle of the model as they get tested at the start of the intervention and I don't want to discount the test cost when I do discounting later on in the model code as though it happened at a later cycle.

# I added the subtyping cost to the list of costs at the start of the code-base as below:
# subtyping_test_cost <- 400

# Now I take the costs for the Experimental arm and I increase the first cycles cost by the subtyping cost as below:
v_tc_Exp["Cycle 1", ] <- v_tc_Exp["Cycle 1", ] + subtyping_test_cost

# Basically, what I'm doing here is selecting "Cycle 1" and adding the value for "subtyping_test_cost" to the value already > v_tc_Exp# As you can see, in v_tc_Exp row one where I want to make the addition is named or labelled Cycle 1.# So, using v_tc_Exp["Cycle 1", ] allows me to access and manipulate the data associated with Cycle 1.
# [,1]
# Cycle 1  2330.82820000
# Cycle 2  2304.75826402
# Cycle 3  2262.84641547

# I'm fairly happy that I'm on the right track here, as the value assigned to Cycle 1 initially was 2330.82820000.

# Which should be the cost of one person in cycle one:
# Cost (Per Cycle)
# FOLFOX	ESP:
# 285.54
# Bevacizumab	ESP: 
# 1325.87
# Administration Cost	ESP:
# 314.94


# The cost of all of the above is:
# 285.54+1325.87+314.94 = 1926.35


# Then we need to incorporate the following adverse event costs:
# Adverse Event Cost	
# Leukopenia	ESP:
# 4885.95
# Diarrhea	ESP: 
# 507.36
# Nausea	ESP:
# 95.03
# However, as below, the adverse events arent guranteed to happen:

# Adverse Event Incidence - With bevacizumab	
# LeukopeniaHR_FP_Exp	0.07
# Diarrhea	0.11
# Nausea	0.07


# So, we get the probability times the cost as follows:# 4885.95*0.07 = 342.0165
# 507.36*0.11 = 55.8096
# 95.03*0.07 = 6.6521

# Giving us:
# 6.6521+55.8096+342.0165 = 404.4782

# Altogether giving us a cost of:
# 285.54+1325.87+314.94+404.4782 = 2330.8282

# Which matches what we had above from the model of the cost in cycle 1:
# And this makes sense, because in cycle 1 (as below) everyone is in the PFS state, so the only costs we need to think about are the costs of being in the PFS state, that is, the FOLFOX, plus Bev plus administration plus any adverse events. But then in cycle 2 onwards people can move into the OS state and then we need to think about the costs I just mentioned plus the cost of FOLFIRI instead of FOLFOX and Bev for those who are in the OS state. So cycle 1 costs from the model should match up with the costs hand calculated from the paper.

# calculate expected QALYs by multiplying cohort trace with the utilities for the different health states 

# The vector of utilities is basically built in the exact same way as the vector of costs above:

# v_tu_SoC  <- m_M_SoC  %*% c(u_H, u_S, u_D)  


# The file I am mirroring has the following qoute:

# "

# - note that to obtain QALYs, the utility needs to be mutiplied by the cycle length as well


# v_tu_SoC <- m_M_SoC %*% c(u_F, u_P, u_D) * t_cycle
# v_tu_Exp <- m_M_Exp %*% c(u_F, u_P, u_D) * t_cycle

# To get the QALY's we not only need to multiply the state occupancy with the utilities, but also with the duration of the time cycle, because QALY's are 2-dimensional in that they combine the duration of time and the health utility.

# "

# Maybe that's because the utility originally came from a year in the disease state, and we want it to reflect the proportion of a year that is our cycle length?

# So in the example t_cycle <- 1/4 # cycle length of 3 months (in years) - so maybe their utility originally came from a years utility and they wanted to decrease it to 3 months, aka the cycle lengths, utility.

# If that was the case it would be:

# A year of utility in this state is 0.75, so 3 months should be a quarter of this, should be 0.25 of this. So, t_cycle (0.25) * u_F (0.75) = 0.1875 i.e. your utility for 3 months if u_F is your utility for 12 months.

# v_tu_SoC <- m_M_SoC %*% c(u_F, u_P, u_D) * t_cycle

# I did the maths on his approach, and without *t_cycle the first cycle of each utility value is 0.8, but after *t_cycle it is 0.2, i.e. a quarter of what it was before. Which is why I think again that he is just making the yearly utility lower to match the 3 monthly cycles, i.e. quartering a yearly utility. A quarter of utility for a quarter of a year.

# So, I think he's just trying to generate the QALYs per cycle in both states.

# And slide 25 of C:\Users\Jonathan\OneDrive - Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland\COLOSSUS\Training Resources\Health Economic Modeling in R A Hands-on Introduction\Health-Eco\Markov models kind of proves that.

# In it they say: cycles are 6 months.

# Their R code in: 

# C:\Users\Jonathan\OneDrive - Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland\COLOSSUS\Training Resources\Health Economic Modeling in R A Hands-on Introduction\Health-Eco\Markov models\markov_smoking_deterministic.R

# Says:

# Now define the QALYS associated with the states per cycle

# QALY associated with 1 - year in the smoking state is Normal(mean = 0.95,  SD = 0.01)
# Divide by 2 as cycle length is 6 months
# state_qalys["Smoking"] <-  0.95 / 2 [I know they divide by 2 but we could have also multiplied by a half, i.e. *0.05].

# QALY associated with 1 - year in the not smoking state is 1 (no uncertainty)
# So all PSA samples have the same value
# Again divide by 2 as cycle length is 6 months
# state_qalys["Not smoking"] <-  1.0 / 2

# I like their approach, they define utility at the start, then they can do the following:

		# Now use the cohort vectors to calculate the 
		# total QALYs for each cycle
		# cycle_qalys[i_treatment, ] <-  cohort_vectors[i_treatment, , ] %*% state_qalys[]

# i.e., take the cohort (or Markov trace) for each of the treatment options and multiply it by the state qalys.

# So, I could take where he says: "QALY's are 2-dimensional in that they combine the duration of time and the health utility." as saying "we need to give the patient a utility for this health state that matches how long they were in this health state, i.e., if the utility of one year in this state is x and we know the patient was in this health state for 2 weeks, then we need to give them 2 weeks of x as their utility."

# I asked new Bing:

# Can you explain this piece of health economic R code for me: total_qalys[i_treatment] <- cycle_qalys[i_treatment, ] %*% (1 / 1.035)^rep(c(0:(n_cycles / 2 - 1)), each = 2)

# Sure, I’ll try to explain the code as best as I can. The code is part of a health economic R package that is used to perform cost-effectiveness analysis or other types of health economic evaluation123. The code is calculating the total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for a treatment group over a number of cycles. Here is a breakdown of the code:
 
# total_qalys[i_treatment] is a vector that stores the total QALYs for each treatment group. i_treatment is an index that indicates which treatment group is being calculated.

# <- is an assignment operator that assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.

# cycle_qalys[i_treatment, ] is a matrix that stores the QALYs for each treatment group and each cycle. The first dimension is the treatment group and the second dimension is the cycle. The code is selecting the row that corresponds to the treatment group indicated by i_treatment.

# %*% is a matrix multiplication operator that multiplies two matrices or vectors together. The code is multiplying the vector of QALYs for each cycle by another vector that represents the discount factor.

# (1 / 1.035)^rep(c(0:(n_cycles / 2 - 1)), each = 2) is a vector that represents the discount factor for each cycle. The discount factor is calculated as (1 / 1.035) raised to the power of the cycle number. The code is using rep() to repeat a sequence of numbers twice, because each cycle consists of two half-cycles. The sequence of numbers is generated by c(0:(n_cycles / 2 - 1)), which creates a vector from 0 to one less than half of the total number of cycles.

# The result of this code is a vector of total QALYs for each treatment group, discounted by 3.5% per year.

# Which support the notion of adjusting the utility to be for a year rather than for a cycle.


# Andrew calculated QALYs as: 
#
# QALYs.SP0 <- trace.SP0%*%state.utilities
# QALYs.SP0
# 
# undisc.QALYs.SP0 <- colSums(QALYs.SP0)
# undisc.QALYs.SP0

# However, he described the values that he started off with as:

# The quality of life utilities of a year spent in each of the model health states has been
# estimated to be 0.85, 0.3 and 0.75 for the Successful primary, Revision, and Successful revision health states respectively.

# and said the cycle length is one year, so maybe that's why he doesnt need to multiply by the time passed, because his utilities are for a year spent in this state, whereas when we start our utilies may not necessarily match.

# So, what I think this means is that provided utilities are for the period of the cycle we can do the below, and if they are not for the period of the cycle then we can just convert them like in the smoking file above and then apply them as though they are for the period of the cycle:






# Moving on

# At the moment I only have 1 utility for the OS state, because once progressed, we assume everyone gets the same treatment (FOLFIRI).

# This is unlike STD and Exp care where people are getting chemo with or without Bev so u_F_SoC stands for utility under SoC and u_F_Exp stands for utility under Bev.

# Above I set u_OS<-u_P, so below I set OS utility equal to this from it's prior u_P value, i.e., c(u_F_SoC, u_P, u_D)


v_tu_SoC <- m_M_SoC %*% c(u_F_SoC, u_OS, u_D)

# Particularly, these are quality adjusted cycles, these are quality adjusted life years where cycles are annual, so I need to consider what this means for utility where cycles are monthly, or fortnightly.

# When I calculate the QALYs above, I don’t convert these quality adjusted cycles to years. If I sum each of v_tu_SoC and v_tu_Exp I get 16.7 quality adjusted cycles in the SoC arm and 21.1 quality adjusted cycles in the Exp arm. I can convert these quality adjusted cycles to years for fortnights by working out how many fortnights there are in a year (26.0714) and then divide by this number. These correspond to 0.64 and 0.81 QALYs respectively so 0.17 QALYs gained.

v_tu_SoC <- v_tu_SoC/26.0714

#v_tc_SoC <- v_tc_SoC/26.0714
#v_tc_Exp <- v_tc_Exp/26.0714


# I'm just trying this to see what implications changing costs to a fortnight value has for ICERs. - I spoke to Eline and there is no need to do this.

# So, these are initially per-cycle utility values, but, our cycles aren't years, they are fortnights, so these are per fortnight values, if we want this value to reflect the per year value, so that we have a quality adjusted life year, or QALY, then we need to adjust this utility value by how many of these fortnights there are in a year (26.0714), that is divide by how many fortnights there are in a year to bring the per fortnight value to a per year value


# James, I'd like your thoughts on what I've done here and whether this seems reasonable.

#I've figured it out for utility, lets say my utility value is 10, in my code I've adjusted by dividing by 26.0714, so a utility of 10/26.0714 gives 0.3835621, however, when you ask New Bing What percentage of a year is 14 days it provides the following response: To calculate the percentage of a year that is 14 days, you can use the formula:

#= YEARFRAC ( DATE ( YEAR ( date),1,1), date)

#This formula returns the fractional years between two dates as a decimal value1. For example, if the date is January 15, 2021, the formula returns 0.0388888888888889, which is 4% when formatted as a percentage.

#To get the percentage of a year that is 14 days, you can use any date that is 14 days after the start of the year. For example, you can use January 15, 2021 as the date and get:

#= YEARFRAC ( DATE (2021,1,1), DATE (2021,1,15))

# This returns 0.0388888888888889, which is 4% when formatted as a percentage.

# Alternatively, you can use an online percentage calculator2 or a days to years converter3 to get the same result. That is, 0.3888889. When you instead MULTIPLY by this value, like he multiplies in the R code, you get 10*0.0388888888888889 = 0.3888889. So, the takeaway is that I was doing the same thing as Koen all along, where he was mulplying his utility values by the percentage of a year they were to scale by cycle length, I was dividing by how many fortnights in a year to scale cycle length.

# Reviewing the literature, the fact that: Goldstein, D. A., Chen, Q., Ayer, T., Howard, D. H., Lipscomb, J., El-Rayes, B. F., & Flowers, C. R. (2015). First-and second-line bevacizumab in addition to chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer: a United States–based cost-effectiveness analysis. Journal of Clinical Oncology, 33(10), 1112. has similar costs, QALYS and Life Years gained and reports similar ICERs (the $352,734/QALY in the UK, which is similar to my own several hundred thousand per QALY without dividing costs by 26.0714 and dissimilar to my ~18,000 per QALY when I divide costs by 26.0714 makes me think I shouldnt be dividing costs by 26.0714).

# Also, I've now answered this for myself above.

```{r}

#07.2 Discounted Mean Costs and QALYs

# Finally, we'll aggregate these costs and utilities into overall discounted mean (average) costs and utilities.

# Obtain the discounted costs and QALYs by multiplying the vectors of total cost and total utility we created above by the discount rate for each cycle:

# Its important to remember what scale I'm on when I applied my discounting formula.
# If I set d_e<-0 then my code estimates 16.7 and 21.1 QALYs in each group which must be the quality adjusted cycles.

# Setting the discount rate back to 4% gives me 1.97 and 1.98 QALYs (which are really QA-cycles).

# Looking at the discounting vector I have defined below, I have converted cycles to days [I actually havent, but this is explained better at the bottom of the code chunk] but I need to convert the discount rate to a daily discount. If I don't, the result is that discounting reduces the cycles dramatically which reduces the difference which increases with time.

# I can adress this by defining the discount rate as divided by 365 (i.e. the number of days in a year) then the results become 16.4 and 20.6 QA-cycles which of course become 0.63 and 0.79 QALYs respectively, or 0.16 QALYs gained.

d_c <- d_c/365
d_e <- d_e/365

# - Then, the discount rate for each cycle needs to be defined accounting for the cycle length, as below:


v_dwc <- 1 / ((1 + d_c) ^ ((0:(n_cycle-1)) * t_cycle)) 
v_dwe <- 1 / ((1 + d_e) ^ ((0:(n_cycle-1)) * t_cycle))


# So, below we take the vector of costs, transposing it [the t() bit] to make it a 1 row matrix and using matrix multiplication [%*%] to multiply it by that discount factor vector, which is what you multiply by the outcome in each cycle to get the discounted value of the outcome for that cycle, and then it will all be summed all together across all cycles [across all cells of the 1 row matrix]. Giving you tc_d_SoC which is a scalar, or a single value, which is the lifetime expected cost for an average person under standard of care in this cohort. 

# Discount costs by multiplying the cost vector with discount weights (v_dwc) 
# tc_d_SoC  <-  t(v_tc_SoC)  %*% v_dwc
# tc_d_trtA <-  t(v_tc_trtA) %*% v_dwc
# tc_d_trtB <-  t(v_tc_trtB) %*% v_dwc

tc_d_SoC <-  t(v_tc_SoC) %*% v_dwc 
tc_d_Exp <-  t(v_tc_Exp) %*% v_dwc


# So, now we have the average cost per person for treatment with standard of care, and the experimental treatment. 


# Discount QALYS by multiplying the QALYs vector with discount weights (v_dwe) [probably utilities would have been a better term here, if I hadnt of updated it from fortnightly health state quality of life, to yearly health state quality of life]

tu_d_SoC <-  t(v_tu_SoC) %*% v_dwe
tu_d_Exp <-  t(v_tu_Exp) %*% v_dwe


# Store them into a vector -> So, we'll take the single values for cost for an average person under standard of care and the experimental treatment and store them in a vector v_tc_d:
v_tc_d <- c(tc_d_SoC, tc_d_Exp)
v_tu_d <- c(tu_d_SoC, tu_d_Exp)

v_tc_d
v_tu_d

# To make things a little easier to read we might name these values what they are costs for, so we can use the vector of strategy names [v_names_str] to name the values:

names (v_tc_d) <- v_names_strats
v_tc_d

names (v_tu_d) <- v_names_strats
v_tu_d


Discounted_Qalys_gained <- tu_d_Exp - tu_d_SoC
sum(Discounted_Qalys_gained)

# For utility, the utility values aren't different for the different states depending on the treatment strategy, i.e. SOC, Experimental Treatment, but the time spent in the states with the associated utility is different due to the treatment you're on, so your utility value will be higher if the treatment keeps you well for longer so that you stay in a higher utility state for longer than a lower utility state, i.e., progression.


# Dataframe with discounted costs and effectiveness

# So then we aggregate them into a dataframe with our discounted costs and utilities, and then we use this to calculate ICERs in: ## 07.3 Compute ICERs of the Markov model

# df_ce <- data.frame(Strategy = v_names_strats,
#                     Cost     = v_tc_d, 
#                     Effect   = v_tu_d)
# df_ce




# According to Bing:


# Explain this health economics R code: v_dwc <- 1 / ((1 + d_c) ^ ((0:(n_cycle-1)) * t_cycle))


# This R code is used to calculate the discount weights for costs in a health economics model. The discount weights are factors that are applied to future costs to reflect their present value. The discount weights depend on the discount rate for costs (d_c), the number of cycles in the model (n_cycle), and the length of each cycle in years (t_cycle).


# But my cycles arent in years, but actually in fortnights: t_cycle <- 14      # cycle length of 2 weeks (in [[days]] - this is assuming the survival curves I am digitising will be in [[days]] if they are in another period I will have to represent my cycle length in that period instead).                                 


# When t_cycle is a percentage of a year, then multiplying the yearly discount rate we start with (i.e., d_c or d_e) by this percentage of a year brings the discount rate to the right time period for the cycle, i.e., if cycles we study are 3 months, then multipling a years discount of 4% by 0.25 (t_cycle is a quarter of a year) gives a 3 month discount rate of 1%, so a per cycle discount rate calculated from the per year discount rate.


# Andy helped me convert my discount rate for costs and my discount rate for effects to days from years, so then I have a cycle length discount rate that matches the cycle length in my study by virtue of my cycle length being 14 days and multiplying a 1 day discount rate by these 14 days to get a 14 day discount rate.


# [the above kind of cements that I really should have created my fortnight as a percentage of a year rather than as 14, but we are where we are now, just have to bear that in mind to simplify the next model. Worth realising as well that it may not have been possible to do this given that I made use of transition data in days from ANGIOPREDICT].



# The code can be explained as follows:

# v_dwc <- assigns the result of the calculation to a variable named v_dwc, which stands for vector of discount weights for costs.

# 1 / divides 1 by the expression in the parentheses, which is the formula for the discount factor for costs.

# (1 + d_c) ^ raises 1 plus the discount rate for costs (d_c) to the power of the expression in the parentheses, which is the formula for the time horizon in years.

# ((0:(n_cycle-1)) * t_cycle) creates a sequence of numbers from 0 to n_cycle-1 and multiplies each number by t_cycle. This gives the time horizon in years for each cycle in the model.

# For example, if d_c = 0.03, n_cycle = 10, and t_cycle = 0.25, then the code will produce a vector of discount weights for costs as follows:

# v_dwc <- 1 / ((1 + 0.03) ^ ((0:9) * 0.25)) v_dwc [1] 1.0000000 0.9925568 0.9851855 0.9778852 0.9706546 [6] 0.9634925 0.9563977 0.9493693 0.9424062 0.9355074
 
# This means that the costs in cycle 1 are not discounted, the costs in cycle 2 are discounted by 0.74%, the costs in cycle 3 are discounted by 1.48%, and so on.

# A simple one-way DSA starts with choosing a model parameter to be investigated. Next, the modeler specifies a range for this parameter and the number of evenly spaced points along this range at which to evaluate model outcomes. The model is then run for each element of the vector of parameter values by setting the parameter of interest to the value, holding all other model parameters at their default base case values.

# OK, so I was wondering why the values reported by the PSA/Tornado plot, differed so significantly to the values found with the baseline Markov model.
# Reviewing the code, I've determined that the reason for these differences is the manner in which the disutility of adverse events is handled in the function in comparison to the baseline analysis in the R Markdown document.
# I've now updated the utility values calculated in the function to match those calculated in the R Markdown document.

# I figured this out because the analysis differed in the effects it reported, which are utilities, but not the costs, which meant that costs and transition probabilities were the same across the different ways I conducted the analysis, but that the utilities were somehow different (transition probabilities would have to be the same, because if they differed even slightly this would change the time people spent in different health states and thus the differences in costs in the different health states would result in differences in overall costs):

# A list containing dataframes with the results of the sensitivity analyses. The list will contain a dataframe for each outcome specified. List elements can be visualized with plot.owsa, owsa_opt_strat and owsa_tornado from dampack

For each row, param_val is the value used for the parameter listed in parameter and outcome_val is the value of the specified outcome for the strategy listed in strategy. 

# So, OWSA_NMB shows a row is created for each sampling of the parameter value from min to max, so 100 rows per parameter (because nsamp = 100,), and the outcome value associated with a parameter value of this size is displayed under outcome_val.

# This link is pretty good for showing that the OWSA can be run across a variety of outcomes outcomes = c("Cost", "QALY", "LY", "NMB"), and then you can pick which of the OWSA outcomes you'd like to focus on and build tornado diagrams, etc., from that:

# "Because we have defined multiple parameters in my_owsa_params_range, we have instructed run_owsa_det to execute a series of separate one-way sensitivity analyses and compile the results into a single owsa object for each requested outcome. When only one outcome is specified run_owsa_det returns a owsa data frame. When more than one outcome is specified, run_owsa_det returns a list containing one owsa data frame for each outcome. To access the owsa object corresponding to a given outcome, one can select the list item with the name “owsa_”.

# To include more descriptive names for the parameters in the tornado diagram, rather than the variable names (i.e., c_PFS_Bevacizumab), I remember that: 

# DSAICER  <- run_owsa_det( is creating a data frame, and then uses owsa_tornado(owsa = DSAICER, txtsize = 11) on this dataframe (DSAICER in the case of the model) to plot this, according to https://rdrr.io/github/DARTH-git/dampack/man/run_owsa_det.html 


# Thus, it is creating DSAICER which exists seperately to the variables I have created in this markdown file. Thus, I can edit the names of the parameters within DSAICER without changing their names within this markdown document (as that would complicate some of the other code I've written which expects their original names).

    TRUE ~ parameter  # I keep the original value if none of the above conditions are met
  ))

# In this code, case_when() is used inside mutate() to change the values of the parameter column based on multiple conditions. The format is condition ~ new_value. If none of the conditions are met, the original value is kept (TRUE ~ parameter).


# The tilde symbol (~) is used in R as a binary infix operator to separate the left-hand side and the right-hand side in a model formula. In the context of the mutate() function and the case_when() function from the dplyr package, it’s used to separate conditions from their corresponding values.

# Here’s how it works:

# mutate(df, new_column = case_when(
#   condition1 ~ value1,
#   condition2 ~ value2,
#   TRUE ~ parameter
# ))

# In this code, ~ separates each condition (condition1, condition2, etc.) from its corresponding value (value1, value2, etc.). If a condition is met (i.e., it evaluates to TRUE), the corresponding value is used. If none of the conditions are met, the parameter value is used (specified by TRUE ~ parameter).

# So, in the context of my code, parameter == "HR_FP_Exp" ~ "Hazard Ratio First to Second Line Treatment Bev" means “if parameter equals HR_FP_Exp, use Hazard Ratio First to Second Line Treatment Bev”.

# In the context of my code, TRUE ~ parameter serves as a default case in the case_when() function.

# That is, in this code, each condition is checked in order. If condition1 is TRUE, value1 is used. If condition2 is TRUE, value2 is used. If none of the conditions are TRUE, then the TRUE ~ parameter line is executed. Since TRUE is always TRUE, this line serves as a catch-all or default case.

# So, TRUE ~ parameter means “if none of the above conditions are met, keep the original value of parameter”. This ensures that the values of parameter that don’t meet any of the specified conditions remain unchanged.

# I look at DSAICER again to see how the above has changed my parameter names:

DSAICER


# If I want to change the bottom of the tornado diagram to say "ICER" instead of the default "Outcome" then I need to remember that: 

# owsa_tornado either return a ggplot object plot or a data frame with ranges of parameters for which each strategy is optimal - per: https://rdrr.io/github/DARTH-git/dampack/man/owsa_tornado.html


# Thus, to change the label at the bottom of the tornado plot from "outcome" to "ICER", I need to modify the ggplot object returned by the owsa_tornado function. Since owsa_tornado returns a ggplot object, I can use standard ggplot2 functions to modify the plot.

# We can address the labelling by accessing the plot object owsa_tornado returns, which is a ggplot object. The labs function can be used to modify the labels post-generation.

# How I previously generated the tornado plot:
# owsa_tornado(owsa = DSAICER, txtsize = 11)

# First I generate the tornado plot using the owsa_tornado function
tornado_plot <- owsa_tornado(owsa = DSAICER, txtsize = 11)

# Then I modify the x-axis label to "ICER" using the labs function from ggplot2, however, bevause the tornado plot generated by owsa_tornado has a horizontal orientation it means the labels are swapped, that is, to change the label on the x-axis correctly, we need to update the y-axis label instead:
tornado_plot <- tornado_plot + labs(y = "ICER")

# I adjust the alignment of the axis labels using the theme function in ggplot2. To center-align the y-axis label ("ICER"), you can specify the axis.title.y element in the theme function and set the vjust parameter to 0.5.

# To add a dynamic title to the tornado plot that includes the country name, I use the ggtitle function from ggplot2. 

# Add a title to the plot using the country name
plot_title <- paste("Tornado Plot", country_name[1])

# I  center the title of the plot in ggplot2 by using the theme function to adjust the alignment. The plot.title element can be customized with the element_text function, where you can set the hjust parameter to 0.5 for center alignment.
# So, the theme function is used to customize the plot.title element.
# So, the element_text function with hjust = 0.5 centers the title horizontally.

# To center-align the y-axis label with the title, :

# We can adjust the alignment of the axis labels using the theme function in ggplot2. To center-align the y-axis label ("ICER"), we can specify the axis.title.y element in the theme function and set the vjust parameter to 0.5.
tornado_plot <- tornado_plot + ggtitle(plot_title) + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), axis.title.y = element_text(vjust = 0.25))

# By adjusting the vjust parameter for axis.title.y, the y-axis label "ICER" is vertically centered. If we also want to adjust the horizontal alignment of the y-axis label, we can use hjust similarly.

# I save the modified plot to a file as before, but now add "plot = tornado_plot":
ggsave(paste("Tornado_Diagram_", country_name[1], ".png", sep = ""), plot = tornado_plot, width = 8, height = 4, dpi=300)
# Close the graphics device
while (!is.null(dev.list()))  dev.off()
#png(paste("Tornado_Diagram_", country_name[1], ".png", sep = ""))
#dev.off()

# The [1] in country_name[1] is used to ensure that only the first element of the country_name vector is used, assuming country_name might be a vector with multiple entries. However, if country_name is a single-element character vector, you can directly use country_name without the [1].

# [SO, IN THE DIAGRAM THE PARAMETER WE ARE CONSIDERING IS AT THE TOP OF THE DIAGRAM, THE NET MONETARY BENEFIT IS ON THE LEFT OF THE DIAGRAM AND YOU'LL SEE THAT THE LEFT EDGE OF THE LINE IS THE MINIMUM VALUE FOR THE PARAMETER WE ARE INTERESTED IN, THE RIGHT EDGE OF THE LINE IS THE MAXIMUM VALUE FOR THE PARAMETER WE ARE INTERESTED IN, AND SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE IS THE BASECASE WE ASSIGNED THIS PARAMETER. A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS IS c_P, COST OF PROGRESSION, say THE BASECASE WAS 1,000 EURO, WHICH WE'D SEE IN THE MIDDLE, THE MINIMUM WAS 800 EURO WHICH WE'D SEE ON THE FAR LEFT OF THE LINE, AND THE MAXIMUM IS 1,200 WHICH WE'D SEE ON THE FAR RIGHT OF THE LINE, AND WE'D SEE THAT AS WE MOVE FROM THE MINUMUM, THE 800 EURO ON THE FAR LEFT OF THE LINE, TO THE MAXIMUM, THE 1200 EURO ON THE FAR RIGHT OF THE LINE (I.E., AS THE COST OF BEING IN THE PROGRESSED STATE INCREASES) THE NET MONETARY BENEFIT OF BOTH TREATMENT OPTIONS FALL, WITH THE NMB OF THE EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT OPTION FALLING FROM 235,000 TO 230,000].

# Because I'm using ICERs, there's only one value, whereas for NMB, there's a value under each treatment strategy, but ICERs are ratios comparing the costs of one treatment strategy to another, and the outcomes of one treatment strategy to another. So, where when I was using NMB as my outcome I would have a curve for "SoC" and "Experimental Treatment", because each would get an NMB, now I only have the one curve, to show how the ICER value changes. So, before I could have how the net monetary benefit changed under each treatment strategy as the cost of treatment A went up, or the rate of changing from healthy to dead went up, per the "# Plot outcome of each strategy over each parameter range" on: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dampack/vignettes/dsa_generation.html, now I only have the ICER, so I see how the ICER changes as the cost of parameters, etc., change.

# Because only one ICER value is created, but it's created for both SoC and Exp, I imagine that the exp line and SoC line are created, but sit on top of eachother in the diagram below, so I don't include this in my paper:

But I think this code is really set up for NMB and telling you what parameter values give you higher NMB values and which treatment strategies these NMB's belong to.

## 08.4 Two-way sensitivity analysis (TWSA)

```{r}


# To conduct the two-way DSA, we call the function run_twsa_det with my_twsa_params_range. The general format of the function arguments for run_twsa_det are the same as those for run_owsa_det. In run_twsa_det, equally spaced sequences of length nsamp are created for the two parameters based on the inputs provided in the params_range argument. These two sequences of parameter values define an nsamp by nsamp grid over which FUN is applied to produce outcomes for every combination of the two parameters. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dampack/vignettes/dsa_generation.html

# The Briggs 2012 paper said to include 2 parameters in the TWSA that have a logical relationship,(e.g., a 2-way uncertainty analysis might be represented by the control intervention event rate and the hazard ratio with the new treatment), which are expected to have a relationship because the hazard ratio for the experimental strategy is multiplied by the rate of events under soc, that's how hazard ratios for experimental interventions work, they are just a multiplier for the number of events under SoC in order to give number of events under Exp care, so more events under SoC means more events under the experimental strategy when it's hazard ratio is applied to the number of events under SoC. In the model, the function is called in the sensitivity analysis and applies a hazard ratio

# I also describe applying the Exp HR to the post changes SoC in my function where this is done.

# I can't use Free to Progressed probabilities, because now those probabilities are time-sensitive, so if I try to change these here and include them in the TWSA I'll be including too many things, just like in the tornado diagram, as I explain in my description on hazard ratios.

# Minimum_p_FP_SoC <- p_FP_SoC - 0.20*p_FP_SoC

# Maximum_p_FP_SoC <- p_FP_SoC + 0.20*p_FP_SoC

# Minimum_p_FP_Exp <- p_FP_Exp - 0.20*p_FP_Exp

# Maximum_p_FP_Exp <- p_FP_Exp + 0.20*p_FP_Exp

# To address this, I can apply this mean, max and min to the hazard ratios instead, knowing that when run_owsa_det is run in the sensitivity analysis it calls the oncology_semi_markov_function to run and in this function the hazard ratios generate the survivor function, and then these survivor functions are used to generate the probabilities (which will be cycle dependent), so I am varying the transition probabilities by 20% using a static value.


# Alterantive modelling approach I could try here if so inclined:


# "When the base-case result of an analysis strongly favors one alternative, a threshold analysis may be presented as a worst-case or ''even if'' analysis (e.g., ''Even if the risk reduction is as low as X, the ICER remains below Y,'' or ''Even if the relative risk reduction with alternative A is as low as X and the cost of treatment is as high as Y, alternative A dominates B''). Threshold values can easily be combined with the tornado presentation by marking them on the horizontal bars."

# Again, I think this is best suited to a NMB, where you will have 2 NMB values, one for EXP and one for SOC, for ICERAs, because it's a ratio between SoC and EXP you will only have one ICER value, and in  the code, both SOC and EXP are assigned it, so in the diagram both colours will sit on top of eachother for SOC and EXP and also, even if changing one thing changes the ICER value, it is changing it for both SOC and EXP, because they both have the same ICER, so there won't be sections of one colour and not another.

### PROBABILISTIC ANALYSIS ----

# We conduct a probabilistic analysis (PSA) of the model to estimate the uncertainty in the model outcomes.

# To do this, we generate samples for each model parameter from parametric distributions and evaluate the model for each set of parameter samples.


## Sampling the parameter values ----

# In order for the results reported in the PSA to be reproducible we need to set the random number seed. We also defining the number of runs, i.e., how many times we will re-sample for the parameter distributions, typically the number chosen is 10,000 in published studies, so we do that too:
n_runs <- 10000
set.seed(123)

# In the PSA, first we sample the parameter values from their distributions and store them in a data.frame.
# If a model parameter has no uncertainty and, hence, is fixed, we can set it equal to itself.


# To take random draws for the Weibull parametric survival distribution that we fitted at the start of the document using the 'flexsurv' package, we use the following piece of code.

# This applies mvrnorm (i.e., takes samples from the specified multivariate normal distribution) to the mean (mu) of 

# l_TTP_SoC_weibull$coefficients
#     shape     scale 
# 0.7700246 1.7425343 

# i.e., to the mean of the shape and the scale variables from the Weibull parametric survival distribution that we fitted.

# And gives a sigma (a positive-definite symmetric matrix specifying the covariance matrix of the variables) that is equal to the covariance between the shape and the scale variables:

# > l_TTP_SoC_weibull$cov
#             shape       scale
# shape 0.001983267 0.000291494
# scale 0.000291494 0.000782051

# You'll see that it's covariance between the two variables because you can match shape with scale twice, and each time it's the same value, so the same covariance between the two variables.

# n is just the number of samples.

# Described here:
# rdocumentation.org/packages/MASS/versions/7.3-58.1/topics/mvrnorm

# So, correlated sets (a "set" here is like one random draw from the distribution, because the draw is for shape and scale at the same time) of coefficients for the survival distribution (i.e., correlated sets of shape and scale values for the survival distribution, which are the coefficients as above) are generated using the variance-covariance matrix that was obtained from fitting the weibull distribution (the cov in l_TTP_SoC_weibull is equal to the covariance between the shape and the scale variables and is printed as a 2 by 2 matrix above) and a multivariate normal distribution (this is just saying we are applying mvrnorm to take samples from the multivariate normal distribution for the mean (mu) values of shape and scale).

# Multivariate normal distribution described here too: https://devinincerti.com/2018/02/10/psa.html'


m_coef_weibull_SoC <- mvrnorm(
  n     = n_runs, 
  mu    = l_TTP_SoC_weibull$coefficients, 
  Sigma = l_TTP_SoC_weibull$cov
)

head(m_coef_weibull_SoC)

m_coef_weibull_OS_SoC <- mvrnorm(
  n     = n_runs, 
  mu    = l_TTD_SoC_weibull$coefficients, 
  Sigma = l_TTD_SoC_weibull$cov
)

head(m_coef_weibull_OS_SoC)



# Now that we have applied mvrnorm to get a random shape and a random scale we don't need to include HR_FP_SoC in our data.frame to create random probability draws for SoC, because we can just select the shape and scale from m_coef_weibull_SoC so that in our function the updated coef_weibull_shape_SoC and coef_weibull_scale_SoC are used to generate S_FP_SoC with a random value, which will in turn generate transition probabilities under standard of care with a random value.










 # According to:

# 
# 
# It is OK to do the following:
# 
# # QALY associated with 1-year in the smoking state is Normal(mean = 0_95, SD = 0_01)
# # Divide by 2 as cycle length is 6 months
# state_qalys[, "Smoking"] <- rnorm(n_samples, mean = 0.95, sd = 0.01) / 2
#   
# So, when doing probabilistic sensitivity analysis and I need my mean and sd for the method of moments this may be useful information when drawing these from population norms.
# This will also be useful for utility and PSA in the adverse event setting.


# I create the SD to include in the sensitivity analysis applied to the hazard ratio below, as I need to create it outside the data.frame for the PSA:

UpperCI <- 0.87
LowerCI <- 0.53
SD <- (log(UpperCI) - log(LowerCI)) / 3.92

MEAN_HR_FP_Exp <- HR_FP_Exp
# I copy the hazard ratio above in case the below would start building HR_FP_Exp from the updated HR_FP_Exp made from random draws, i.e., in case it started including the HR_FP_Exp updated from the random draws from HR_FP_Exp in meanlog = (HR_FP_Exp), when we really need to be drawing the variability from the hazard ratio we started out with, and not a hazard ratio that we started out with, but that has since already been varied and will be varied from again if we take a random draw from this pre-varied hazard ratio.

# HR_FP_Exp = rlnorm(n_runs, meanlog = log(HR_FP_Exp), sdlog = SD)

# !!! I MAY NEED TO REPEAT THIS FOR: HR_PD_Exp

# I create the SD to include in the sensitivity analysis applied to the hazard ratio below, as I need to create it outside the data.frame for the PSA:

OS_UpperCI <- 0.86
OS_LowerCI <- 0.49
OS_SD <- (log(OS_UpperCI) - log(OS_LowerCI)) / 3.92

MEAN_HR_PD_Exp <- HR_PD_Exp

# So, this is the PSA input dataset.

df_PA_input <- data.frame(

  coef_TTD_weibull_shape_SoC = m_coef_weibull_OS_SoC[ , "shape"],
  coef_TTD_weibull_scale_SoC = m_coef_weibull_OS_SoC[ , "scale"],
             

  
### Hazard Ratios  
  
# People use exp for rnorm (i.e., to make random draws from a normal distribution) but I to use want rlnorm.

#  HR_FP_Exp = exp(rnorm(n_runs, log(0.6), 0.08))

# The rlnorm() function in R is used for generating random draws from a log-normal distribution.
 
# To make draws from the log-normal distribution you need to enter a hazard ratio and standard deviation.

# If you find a hazard ratio and confidence interval in the literature, rather than a hazard ratio and a standard deviation, you can make conversions to a standard deviation.

# To generate random draws for the hazard ratio, I need a mean for the hazard ratio(just the hazard ratio value itself), and a standard deviation built from the 95% confidence interval of the hazard ratio (the SD is built from log(Upper CI) - log(Lower CI)/2*SE, so sd is already built from logs for inclusion in rlnorm and doesnt need to be set as sdlog = log() unlike meanlog = log() where you need to take the log of the hazard ratio value). 


# SD: (natural log(Upper confidence interval) -  natural log(lower confidence interval) / 2*Standard error (i.e. 1.95*2 = 3.92 for a 95% confidence interval)


# So, it looks like I take the natural log of the upper limit minus the natural log of the lower limit (in confidence intervals the lower limit is reported on the left and the upper limit is reported on the right, so it would be 95% CI (30.0 [LOWER LIMIT], 34.2[UPPER LIMIT]), and I would rearrange these to have [ln(UPPER LIMIT) - ln(LOWER LIMIT)], i.e., [ln(34.2)-ln(30.0)]) and divide by 2 times the standard error. Provided the sample size is large, then for the 95% confidence interval this would be 2 x 1.96 = 3.92 For 90% confidence intervals 3.92 should be replaced by 3.29, and for 99% confidence intervals it should be replaced by 5.15. 

# I often come across hazard ratios and their confidence intervals in the published literature on clinical trials, but rarely do I see standard deviations. 
 
# A typical example from the literature is the following: "HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.89 in mCRC for cetuximab plus FOLFOX-4 vs FOLFOX-4 alone" -  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7044820/pdf/bmjopen-2019-030738.pdf:
# 
# To compute the standard deviation for hazard ratios from the above typical reports in the literature, so that I can then generate random draws from a log-normal distribution for a hazard ratio I would do the following:
# 
# (natural log(Upper confidence interval) -  natural log(lower confidence interval) / 2*Standard error (i.e. 1.95*2 = 3.92 for a 95% confidence interval)
# 
# or in R: (log(0.89) - log(0.54)) / 3.92 = 0.1274623
# 
# 
# UpperCI <- 0.89
# LowerCI <- 0.54
# SD <- (log(UpperCI) - log(LowerCI)) / 3.92
# SD = 0.1274623
# 

# If I need to provide a citation for this formula I can use the below which, although this does not provide the formula I use, it provides enough information that is similar to the above, and which I could say ultimately informed the formula:
# Higgins, J. P. T., & Deeks, J. J. (2011). Chapter 7.7. 3.3: Obtaining standard deviations from standard errors, confidence intervals, t values and P values for differences in means. Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions, Version, 5(0).
# 
# 
# This approach is also supported by the following post, which provides good clarity on all of the above:
# 
# https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/546192/calculate-the-standard-deviation-from-a-hazard-ratios-confidence-interval


# random draws from a log-normal distribution

# hr_draws <- rlnorm(nsims, meanlog = log(mean), sdlog = SD). 

# 
# We take random draws from the log-normal distribution for ratios, because if we were to take random draws from the ratio as it stands, because the hazard ratio can't go any lower than 0 but can go to plus infinity, our random draws would be skewed in the values we take from the distribution, on the other hand, if we were to put things on the natural log scale we would be taking our random draws from a more normalised distribution. So, you'll see that in:
# 
# rlnorm(n_sim, meanlog = log(mean),  sdlog = SD)
# 
# it's the log of the mean (the ratio value, so the hazard ratio) and the log of the standard deviation (which we put on the log scale when we calculate it so we don't need to put in as sdlog = log() here, just sdlog = ) in order to be taking random draws from a log-normal distribution (i.e. a log normally distributed HAZARD RATIO).

HR_FP_Exp = rlnorm(n_runs, meanlog = log(MEAN_HR_FP_Exp), sdlog = SD),
HR_PD_Exp = rlnorm(n_runs, meanlog = log(MEAN_HR_PD_Exp), sdlog = OS_SD),


# Per [SLIDE 16] onwards in C:\Users\Jonathan\OneDrive - Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland\COLOSSUS\Training Resources\Decision Modelling - Advanced Course\A2_Making Models Probabilistic\A2.1.2 Distributions for parameters\notes.txt I don't think we need to worry about the duration of time a hazard ratio refers to. In my model I definitely don't, as the hazard ratio and underlying rate survival curves that make up SoC transition probabilities come from the same paper, and thus the same time period. 























#### To generate random draws for the probabilities:

# IMPORTANT, THIS VALUE IS BOUNDED BY 1 OR 0:
# When calculating se from point estimates, remember that utility and probability values cannot be less than 0 or greater than 1, so don't calculate a min or max that is less than 0 or greater than 1. If you do, then change it to be 0 or 1, as appropriate, i.e., rather than 1.02, make it 1.

# When, as in slide 12 of C:\Users\Jonathan\OneDrive - Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland\COLOSSUS\Training Resources\Decision Modelling - Advanced Course\A2_Making Models Probabilistic\A2.1.2 Distributions for parameters\a212ProbabilisticDistributions-210604-154.pdf you can have many transitions from one state into others [i.e. in A you can stay in State A or you can go into State B, State C or State D rather than just going from state C into State D] it's not clear how you can do this in the beta code.

# i.e., when alpha values are all the times things happened, while  beta values are all the times they didnt, how do you apply 

# transistion_probabiliy <- rbeta(n_runs,alpha,beta)
# when there are so many things that can happen?

# FOR NON-MULTI STATE, I.E. FOR THE SICK TO DEAD STATE IN THE MARKOV MODEL YOU CAN APPLY THE BETA DISTRIBUTION, BECAUSE YOU CAN ONLY LEAVE (ALPHA) OR STAY (BETA).

# Sometimes a Dirichlet is suggested, a Dirichlet distribution is the multidimensional generalization of the beta distribution, so it's the same as applying the beta distribution, - as per: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/rBeta2009/versions/1.0/topics/rdirichlet but I would need to have all the counts included I think, which works when you are drawing all your transition data from one larger dataset, like in a clinical trial, but my data necessarily comes from several sources, so I if I just build everything as conditional probabilities, per my notes in this Notepad [search 19/08/22: in C:\Users\Jonathan\OneDrive - Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland\COLOSSUS\Training Resources\Decision Modelling - Advanced Course\A2_Making Models Probabilistic\A2.1.2 Distributions for parameters\notes.txt] in combination with the slides [C:\Users\Jonathan\OneDrive - Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland\COLOSSUS\Training Resources\Decision Modelling - Advanced Course\A2_Making Models Probabilistic\A2.1.2 Distributions for parameters\a212ProbabilisticDistributions-210604-154.pdf] these are notes on, that is 1-Probabilities like I've done in R already, then I should be able to apply a Beta distribution to each probability and not have to worry about applying a Dirichlet.


# If I ever wanted to do a Dirichlet from say a clinical trial or something and I wanted to do a PSA with this, here's how: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/heemod/vignettes/e_probabilistic.html


# This source also demonstrates how to use a gamma distribution for costs: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/heemod/vignettes/e_probabilistic.html 


# Here's a quote explaining how best to do that from my notes above:

# "In the above you would have a beta distribution with parameters 731, 527 [the 512+15] to look at whether you stayed in State B and then, conditional on leaving State B, we could assign another beta distribution with parameters 512 and 15 to whether you, conditional on having left State B then transited to State C. And, of course, death is then the third category. Death is the residual probability. [i.e., conditional on having left state B is 1-the probability of staying in State B, so you could apply a Beta distribution to the probability of going into State C multiplied by 1-the probability of staying in State B. Death would be 1-the probability you create of moving into State C, because if you're not going into State C then you're going into Death as there's nowhere else for you to go, I think if you wanted to apply a Beta distribution to Death you could apply a Beta distribution to the probability of going into Death and then multiply that by 1-the probability of staying in the B state]."

# Conditional probabilities are built from the below p_'s in the function, so you basically create the beta distribution probabilities below as p_'s, and then in the function you multiply them by 1-whatever probability as necessary such that they become conditional probabilities.

##1

# Fitting Beta distributions to (constant) probability parameters [I guess the "constant" here is to clarify that this isnt how you do it for time varying transition probabilities, like the transition probabilities I create from Weibull].

# There are two main ways to do this, per: C:\Users\Jonathan\OneDrive - Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland\COLOSSUS\Training Resources\Decision Modelling - Advanced Course\A2_Making Models Probabilistic\A2.3 Practical exercise R\A231_Making_Models_Proba.pdf say you had something like the following printed in a study:

# ‘The hospital records of a sample of 100 patients receiving a primary THR were examined retrospectively. Of these patients, two patients died either during or immediately following the procedure. The operative mortality for the procedure is therefore estimated to be 2%.’

# You could use this information directly to specify the parameters (alpha and beta) of a beta distribution for the probability of operative mortality during primary surgery. These are noted by “a.” and “b.” respectively. Your alpha values are all the times things happened, while your beta values are all the times they didnt, so 2 and 98.

# alpha <- 2 ## alpha value for operative mortality from primary surgery
# beta <- 100- alpha ## beta value for operative mortality from primary surgery

# tp.PTHR2dead <- rbeta(n_runs,alpha,beta) ## Operative mortality rate  (OMR) following primary THR

# (as coded in C:\Users\Jonathan\OneDrive - Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland\COLOSSUS\Training Resources\Decision Modelling - Advanced Course\A2_Making Models Probabilistic\A2.3 Practical exercise R\A233_Making_Models_Probabilistic_Solutions-210604 (1))

# The question is, does this give the transition probability for the time period that the quote describes? Well in the same pdf and r code as above you have the following:

# "The following information has been provided to you concerning revision procedures among patients already having had a revision operation (i.e. the re-revision risk). ‘The hospital records of a sample of 100 patients having experienced a revision procedure to replace a failed primary THR were reviewed at one year. During this time, four patients had undergone a further revision procedure.’iv) Use this information to fit a constant transition probability for the annual re-revision rate parameter (tp.rrr), using the same approach as for operative mortality above. Your beta value for re-revision risk should be equivalent to 96."


# a.rrr <- 4   ## alpha value for re-revision risk
# b.rrr <- 100-a.rrr  ## beta value for re-revision risk
# tp.rrr <-rbeta(1,a.rrr,b.rrr) ## Re-revision risk transition probability

# tp.PTHR2dead
# tp.RTHR2dead
# tp.rrr


# Because the cycle length in the model is one year according to page 3 of C:\Users\Jonathan\OneDrive - Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland\COLOSSUS\Training Resources\Decision Modelling - Advanced Course\A1_Advanced Markov Modelling\A1.3 Practical exercise R\A131_Advanced_Markov_Modelling_Instructions-210528-18 this indicates that it does.

                          # METHOD OF MOMENTS:


# In cases where you don't have this information, but you do have a mean and a standard error, you can do the following (per: C:\Users\Jonathan\OneDrive - Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland\COLOSSUS\Training Resources\Decision Modelling - Advanced Course\A2_Making Models Probabilistic\A2.1.2 Distributions for parameters\notes.txt):

# My initial reading for probabilistic analysis with probabilities suggested that the method of moments can be applied to a mean and standard error for a transition probability sourced from the literature to create an appropriate alpha and beta to use in a probabilistic sensitivity analysis:

# So, I built the following code to translate the formula for the methods of moments into R, to allow us to take our transition probabilities from the literature:
# 
# 
#  ## Methods of moments
# 
# 
# #Assume the below mean and std error come from the reported literature
# 
# mean <- 0.75 ## mean from the literature
# std.error <- 0.04 ## standard error from the literature
# 
# # The method of moments can be coded up as below to get the alpha and beta from the sample using the mean and standard error from the sample:
# 
# alpha.plus.beta <- mean*(1-mean)/(std.error^2)-1 ## alpha + beta (ab)
# alpha <- mean*alpha.plus.beta ## alpha (a)
# beta <- alpha*(1-mean)/mean ## beta(b)
# 
# # Following this, you can randomly draw from the beta distribution using the below, I only have one random draw, but you could change that 1 to 10,000 (the standard number of draws) and save these as a matrix of draws to use in your probabilistic sensitivity analysis:
# 
# probabilistic.beta.dist.draw <- rbeta(1,alpha,beta) ## drawing from the Beta distribution based on a and b

# Per the above pdf:

# "Note that the rbeta function takes 3 arguments, first the number of draws or samples, the alpha parameter (named shape1) and the beta parameter (named shape2)." 
# "rbeta(n = 5, shape1 = 50, shape2 = 100)"

# while in their R code they use the below, as included above, so I don't think it matters if you include shape1= or just include the alpha and beta directly, but I'll keep it as below, as that's how DARTH do it. 

# tp.rrr <-rbeta(1,a.rrr,b.rrr) ## Re-revision risk transition probability

# The below gives the same results either way:

# set.seed(100)
# n = 1
# b4 <- rbeta(n, shape1 = 2, shape2 = 8)
# b4
# [1] 0.1329533
# 
# set.seed(100)
# n = 1
# b4 <- rbeta(n, 2, 8)
# b4
# [1] 0.1329533

# RANGE:

# I don't describe generating random draws when the probabilities don't have an SE above, however, I can do this in the same way that I figured out how to do this for the utility beta distributions below. If they are reported with a range, he section on utility below also advises how to handle this.

# 1) COSTS WITH A RANGE:



# Maximum <- SOMEVALUEHERE
# Mean <- SOMEVALUEHERE

# se                                  
 
# mean <-Mean

# se.cIntervention <- se ## standard error of cost of intervention
 
# a.cIntervention <- (mn.cIntervention/se.cIntervention)^2 ## alpha value for cost of intervention (shape)
# b.cIntervention <- (se.cIntervention^2)/mn.cIntervention ## beta value for cost of intervention (scale)
 
# a.cIntervention
# b.cIntervention
 
 
# c_H   = rgamma(n_sim, shape = a.cIntervention, scale = b.cIntervention),  # cost of intervention
 
# If costs are reported with a 95% confidence interval the maximum is the upper confidence interval. If the interval is not centered on the mean, use the maximum or minimum in place of the upper confidence interval, depending on which one is further away from the mean SE = (m-CIlower)/t, here the bit in the brackets is rearranged when dealing with lower limits to have the MEAN minus the lower confidence interval so that things don't become negative (because the lower value will of course always be lower than the mean, as it's supposed to be below the mean, so a smaller number minus a larger number will be negative), but when the interval is centered on the mean the formula of SE = (CIupper-m)/t and SE = (m-CIlower)/t are inherently doing the same thing, that is getting the difference between the mean and the confidence interval and dividing this by t. So both formulas are options to use in getting the SE, and an author may choose to use the one which incorporates the interval that is farthest from the mean in order to incorporate as much variability in doing this SE calculation as possible, i.e. to reflect the variability in their SE calculation.

# As per: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/550293/how-to-calculate-standard-error-given-mean-and-confidence-interval-for-a-gamma-d/550892#550892
 
 
# "I would like to note that, while those values in the table happen to correspond with ±2σ, the minimum and maximum values do not generally follow such simple formula with mean plus-minus some standard deviation.
 
# In this case, the minimum and maximum values only correspond to the interval μ±2σ because the distribution seems to have been truncated at those values."
 
 
# i.e., my formula will only work if the minimum and maximum values reported in a study are ±2 SE from the mean, i.e. + 2 SE from the mean for the maximum value, and -2 SE from the mean for the minimum value.
 
# And that will be the case any time there is a 95% Confidence Interval:
 

# [ "Since 95% of values fall within two standard deviations of the mean according to the 68-95-99.7 Rule, simply add and subtract two standard deviations from the mean in order to obtain the 95% confidence interval. Notice that with higher confidence levels the confidence interval gets large so there is less precision." https://www.westga.edu/academics/research/vrc/assets/docs/confidence_intervals_notes.pdf also saved here: C:\Users\Jonathan\OneDrive - Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland\COLOSSUS\Training Resources\Decision Modelling - Advanced Course\A2_Making Models Probabilistic\A2.1.2 Distributions for parameters\gammadist\confidence_intervals_notes.pdf

# So, if I'm taking my costs and a range about these costs from the literature, I just need to make sure the range is a 95% Confidence Interval, like that reported here: Tilson, L., Sharp, L., Usher, C., Walsh, C., Whyte, S., O’Ceilleachair, A., ... & Barry, M. (2012). Cost of care for colorectal cancer in Ireland: a health care payer perspective. The European journal of health economics, 13(4), 511-524. (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51188456_Cost_of_care_for_colorectal_cancer_in_Ireland_A_health_care_payer_perspective) reports a cost in Table 3 for Colorectal cancer with a 95% CI: € 48,835 (€40,548–€62,582)..

# For "PK test cost MEAN: 400.00 MIN: 300.00 MAX: 500.00" from Table 4, row 3 page 222 in Goldstein, D. A., Chen, Q., Ayer, T., Howard, D. H., Lipscomb, J., Harvey, R. D., ... & Flowers, C. R. (2014). Cost effectiveness analysis of pharmacokinetically-guided 5-fluorouracil in FOLFOX chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer. Clinical colorectal cancer, 13(4), 219-225 plugged into the formula above to find the SE, I get an SE of 50, so plugging the 50 and mean into the CI = m ± t*SE from Jochen above I get:
 
# 400 + 2*50 = 500
 
# 400 - 2*50 = 300
 
# Which is the same confidence interval as I got in the Table 4 row 3, i.e. 300 and 500.
 
# So, this might be a good way to check if my standard error is correct. Although this will only work if my confidence interval is centred on the mean, i.e. if I am the same distance from the mean to the max and to the min. If my confidence interval is NOT centred on the mean, I can calculate 2 standard errors, one between the lower interval and the mean, and one between the upper interval and the mean, and then apply these in CI = m ± t*SE, knowing that:

# CIupper = m + t*SE

# CIlower = m - t*SE

# I've figured out a simple test for whether the max/min reported is ±2σ:
# se <- ((Max) - (Mean)) / 2
# MaxMatch <- Mean + 2*se 
# MinMatch <- Mean - 2*se
 
# I can then check if the max/min reported in a Table match the above, and if so I know that the max/min reported is ±2σ.
 
# If not, it may be that they used the se off the minimum as it's further away, so try the below:
 
# se <- ((Mean) - (Min)) / 2
# MaxMatch <- Mean + 2*se 
# MinMatch <- Mean - 2*se
 
 
# I can then check if the max/min reported in a Table match the above, and if so I know that the max/min reported is ±2σ.
 
 
 
 
# Even if it's not symmetric, this may still be a 95% confidence interval if the mean is at 2 of one of the standard errors from the min or the max, we can see this in action below:
 
 
# > Maximum <- 27655.84
# > Mean <- 11565.60
# > 
# > se <- ((Maximum) - (Mean)) / 2
# > se                                  
# [1] 8045.12
# > 
# > MaxMatch <- Mean + 2*se 
# > MinMatch <- Mean - 2*se
# > MaxMatch
# [1] 27655.84
# > MinMatch
# [1] -4524.64
 
# But still, for these values
 
# FN: Value: 11,565.60 Minimum: 7092.16 Maximum: 27,655.84  Distribution: γ: (2.067, 5596.247)
 
# that are not centered on the mean, this still came out the same as the Table using this se <- ((Maximum) - (Mean)) / 2 method. Because looking at the below, the upper interval (the maximum) is further from the mean at a difference of 16090.24, than the lower interval (the minimum) at a difference between it and the mean of 4473.44 (i.e. the maximum is nearly four times further away from the mean that the minimum).
 
 
# > Maximum <- 27655.84
# > Minimum <- 7092.16
# > Mean <-  11565.60
  
# > Maximum - Mean
# [1] 16090.24
  
# > Mean - Minimum
# [1] 4473.44
 
 
# And when we plug the se in for the further away max we get:
 
 
# > a.cIntervention
# [1] 2.066671
# > b.cIntervention
# [1] 5596.247
 
# Just the same as the values for FN above.
# 

# So, this kind of applies to situations where an interval is reported, when you might want to check if it's a 95% confidence interval, and if not, which interval is furthest from the mean, in cases of a point estimate only, you do the following:




# 2) POINT ESTIMATE ONLY:

# If they arent reported with a 95% confidence interval, the Goldstein paper says: "Drug costs were varied within +/-20% of their baseline values as previously done by Goulart and Ramsey".
 
# I checked this for FOLFOX drug cost Min: 443.91 Value: 355.13 Max: 532.69  gamma(100, 4.439)
 
# Mean<-   443.91
# Maximum <- Mean + 0.20*Mean
# Minimum <- Mean - 0.20*Mean
 
# Taking 20% plus the mean and 20% minus the mean, I get the same maximum and minimum as above, exactly:
 
# > Maximum
# [1] 532.692
# > Minimum
# [1] 355.128
 
# They still applied the SE = (CIupper-m)/t or SE = (m-CIlower)/t to this interval which they generated from 20% plus the mean and 20% minus the mean.

# In the Goldstein 2014 paper, where the ranges are more than 20% away from the mean, i.e., 25%, etc., they use the same formula for ranges that are symmetrically far from the mean, i.e., 25% bigger or smaller than the mean, and they use the same formula but incoporating the range that's furthest from the mean when generating the se when the ranges arent symmetric about the mean.





# OK, so the question is, can we apply any percentage we like to the point estimate we find for costs to generate the max or min and then just apply the formula above to generate the SE? I reviewed Koen's study below:

# Degeling, K., Franken, M. D., May, A. M., van Oijen, M. G., Koopman, M., Punt, C. J., ... & Koffijberg, H. (2018).

# In the excel file, on the second sheet there is a row called parameter 1. For cost this parameter is the alpha value, and when you click on 16.000 it shows the formula that created this alpha value, which is the same as for my alpha value formula above. This formula includes the mean and the SE. When I take the mean (which is just the baseline value) and plug this into the R code to generate the SE:

# I get the same se as in the excel file when making the max and min 50% larger or smaller than the mean in the code below. 
# Mean<-   2062.35
# Maximum <- Mean + 0.50*Mean
# Minimum <- Mean - 0.50*Mean
# se <- ((Maximum) - (Mean)) / 2
# se
# 515.5875

# Even more important, they apply the same code as I have for creating the alpha value above using this mean and SE generated just from taking 50% either side of the mean. 

# The implication of this is that you can generate the SE of a point estimate by taking any percentage either side of the mean and that you can also apply the code as above to generate the alpha and beta. Unfortunately in the excel file they don't create the beta in parameter 2, but the lambda, which is something else again. 


# This may solve the riddle of lambda in Koen's code, I noticed that here they use 1/Beta: https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/beta-and-gamma-function-implementation-in-r so I took that approach with the Lambda in Koen's code, plugging it in for beta, and got the same value of the mean as I started out with.

# c_H   = rgamma(10000, shape = a.cIntervention, scale = 1/b.cIntervention) # cost of intervention
# mean(c_H)
 

# Likewise, if I do the following:

# 1/ b.cIntervention
# I get the exact same value for b.cIntervention as when I use the original code to generate b.cIntervention from Andy, as below.

# b.cIntervention <- (se.cIntervention^2)/mn.cIntervention ## beta value for cost of intervention (scale)
# b.cIntervention

# So, it looks like the whole Lambda thing is just a different way of getting b.cIntervention, but Koen's way of doing it requires the addition of 1/ for the scale part of rgamma, while Andy's method doesnt.

# So, in this it looks like Andy is generating the scale for the beta, while Koen is generating the rate:

# "There is a R function for simulating this random variable. Here in addition to the number of values to simulate, we just need two parameters, one for the shape and one for either the rate or the scale. The rate is the inverse of the scale. The general formula is: rgamma(n, shape, rate = 1, scale = 1/rate)." https://pubs.wsb.wisc.edu/academics/analytics-using-r-2019/gamma-variables-optional.html also saved here: C:\Users\Jonathan\OneDrive - Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland\COLOSSUS\Training Resources\Decision Modelling - Advanced Course\A2_Making Models Probabilistic\A2.1.2 Distributions for parameters\13.7 Gamma Variables (Optional) _ Analytics Using R.pdf

# I think the code above also implies that if you were to include it as a "rate" instead of calling it scale in the rcode for Koen's rate, then you wouldnt need to do the 1/ bit over scale. So, he may have taken this approach as well.This is supported by: "rate:	a numeric vector in the range [0, Inf) that specifies the inverse of the scale parameter." https://docs.tibco.com/pub/enterprise-runtime-for-R/4.1.1/doc/html/Language_Reference/stats/GammaDist.html

# This is supported by the below:

# > set.seed(1)
# > x <- rgamma(n = 1000, shape = 5, scale = 3)
# > mean(x)
# [1] 14.61593
# Knowing that the rate is the inverse of the scale, we can get the rate as 1/3 below:
# > 1/3
# [1] 0.3333333
# > set.seed(1)
# > x <- rgamma(n = 1000, shape = 5, rate = 0.3333333)
# > mean(x)
# [1] 14.61593
# > set.seed(1)
# > x <- rgamma(n = 1000, shape = 5, scale = 1/0.3333333)
# > mean(x)
# [1] 14.61593

# Thus, Koen generated the rate and used that in rgamma, while Andy showed me how to use scale and use that in rgamma. 


# This 20% approach is also taken by Lesley tilson and cited in her study and other studies here: https://trello.com/c/m653JBWV/48-20-cost-sensitivity

##### POINT ESTIMATES ONLY:



# IMPORTANT, THIS VALUE IS BOUNDED BY 1 OR 0:
# When calculating se from point estimates, remember that utility and probability values cannot be less than 0 or greater than 1, so don't calculate a min or max that is less than 0 or greater than 1. If you do, just round it to 0 or 1.


# If you have a point estimate, then you can generate the standard error/standard deviation using the method of moments again.

#Per Table 4 in the Goldstein paper:
# > mean<-   0.850
# > Maximum <- mean + 0.20*mean
# > Maximum
# [1] 1.02
# > Minimum <- mean - 0.20*mean
# > Minimum
# [1] 0.68
# > se <- ((Maximum) - (mean)) / 2
# > se  
# [1] 0.085
# > std.error <- se
# > alpha.plus.beta <- mean*(1-mean)/(std.error^2)-1 ## alpha + beta (ab)
# > alpha <- mean*alpha.plus.beta ## alpha (a)
# > beta <- alpha*(1-mean)/mean ## beta(b)
# > alpha
# [1] 14.15
# > beta
# [1] 2.497059
# So, a perfect match to the Goldstein paper.
# Because this approach to point estimates ends up making the same range around this point estimate as reported in Table 4, the implication is that when a point estimate is reported with a range, you can generate the SE the exact same way as above, that is, se <- ((Maximum) - (mean)) / 2, because we are applying the same manner of generating the SE to the range that was reported in the paper, as to the point estimate.


# I double check the manner in which I calculate the SE with the excel file from Koen's paper: C:\Users\Jonathan\OneDrive - Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland\COLOSSUS\Training Resources\Decision Modelling - Advanced Course\A2_Making Models Probabilistic\A2.1.2 Distributions for parameters\Matching the model with the evidence Koen both are saved here, but the filepath may be too long to access them without moving them to downloads or desktop.

# For his paper, I update the Maximum/Minimum part by taking the max as 50% bigger than the mean. When I do this, I get the exact same SE as he reports in the excel file, I know this because in his cells creating the alpha and beta values for utility or probability on sheet 2 of his excel file, he includes 2 numbers, one is the mean reported on sheet 1 for the parameter whose utility or probability he is taking random draws from, and then the other number is an EXACT match for the SE number I calculate, and must therefore be the SE number he calculates. Especially because he then applies a formula to this mean and SE to generate the alpha and the beta. You can see this in my model code below, where the mean and SE I report in my own analysis turn up in his alpha and beta formulas.

# Although he uses a different method to calculate the alpha and the beta, these typically work out as very close to the values calculated for the alpha and beta using my method, which Briggs told me to use once I had the SE and mean, so I think Koen just has a deeper understanding of mathematics and is using this to apply a different formula for the generation of alpha and beta from the SE and mean.

# The takeaway here is that my method for calculating SE is correct, as proven by Koen's excel file, and once I have the SE and the mean (mean is just the point estimate value I started with for this parameter) Andrew Briggs told me what to do to calculate the alpha and the beta, so I now can be confident in the manner in which I take the PSA for utility or probability when it comes to beta distributions.

## RANGE:

##### Calculating Beta values when you have a range around your point estimate in the literature (THIS CAN BE APPLIED TO PROBABILITY OR UTILITY): 


# Here are my formulas, and if you read further below you can see how I got to these formulas.

# Here's the bottomline takeaway on the Beta formuala. My SE's are typically very close to the SE's that I recover from the published studies. I've seen first hand, that you need big changes to the SE to affect the mean you draw in the PSA. So, what I'll do is apply the briggse or altbriggse as appropriate, and then when I do the PSA I'll check the mean on the parameter drawn from the PSA draws to make sure the parameter is on average the same as the one we started with, I can do this by doing mean() whatever the parameter is, and that will show me the average value.

# Briggs code to generate the SE for a parameter with a range perfectly centered around the mean (briggsse), and then repeated but for the situations where the range isnt PERFECTLY centered around the mean (altbriggsse), i.e., the min is further away from the mean than the max, or vice versa (even a little):

# briggsse <- ((max)-(mean))/1.96
# altbriggsse <- (max-min)/(2*1.96)

## Generating the alpha and beta:

# mean <- Somevaluehere

# std.error <- briggsse OR altbriggsse - as appropriate
# alpha.plus.beta <- mean*(1-mean)/(std.error^2)-1 ## alpha + beta (ab)
# alpha.plus.beta
# alpha <- mean*alpha.plus.beta ## alpha (a)
# beta <- alpha*(1-mean)/mean ## beta(b)
# alpha
# beta
# 
# u_ME       = rbeta(10000, shape1 =  a, shape2 = b)
# mean(u_ME)

# I could also create alpha and beta using Koen's code, which is a different way of calculating these vales than what Briggs showed me, but typically gives the same alpha and beta, so can be ignored:

# newalpha =(((mean)^2)*(1-(mean))/((se)^2)-(mean))
# newbeta =((1-(mean))*(((1-(mean))*(mean))/((se)^2)-1))
# newalpha
# newbeta


# Calculating a Beta distribution when you have a range around this in the literature you are reviewing:

# All of the below applies to probabilities as well as utilities, as both are for beta distributions.

# To determine the best way to do this, I open all the sources I mention just above which include a range, se, alpha, beta, etc., and then I apply all the methods I have and see which is best. I'll also be heavily guided by the suggestions Andy made, as he has being doing this work for 2 decades, if he says that a certain way is correct, I'll take him at his word. Lesley also made some suggestions.

# Discounting:
  
# A uniform distribution is a probability distribution in which every value between an interval from a to b is equally likely to be chosen. https://www.statology.org/uniform-distribution-r/
  
# "Generates random values that are evenly spread between min and max bounds" - https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E57185_01/CYBUG/apcs03s03s01.html 

# Devin Incerti talks about the Uniform distribution here: "The uniform distribution is useful when there is little data available to estimate a parameter and determine its distribution. It is always preferable to place uncertainty on a parameter even when there is little evidence for it than to assume a fixed value (which gives a false sense of precision). Sampling from the uniform distribution is straightforward." https://devinincerti.com/2018/02/10/psa.html  
  
#Reading the literature, it seems like studies pick a lower bound and upper bound for the discount rate, such that the average (mean of the discount rate) will reach the point estimate they started with:

# # To check that the above DSAICER is actually calculating the ICER values, I manually checked this by exporting the dataframe of costs and effects from SoC and Exp to Excel and then manually calculated the ICERs, and the ICERs calculated in the Excel match those in DSAICER (in MANUAL ICER CALCULATIONS IRELAND.xlsx):
# 
# write.csv(DSAICER,'DSAICER.csv')
# write.csv(df_e,'df_eGER.csv')
# write.csv(df_c,'df_cGER.csv')
# 

# When I averaged the ICERs in DSAICER they didnt match the ICER created below, in table_cea_PA, but I did match the ICER in the table with the ICER I created by averaging the incremental costs and effects (which matchered the incremental costs and effects in the table when I averaged these) and creating the ICER by dividing the average incremental cost by the average incremental utility, so it must just be that they calculate their ICER in the table by dividing the average incremental cost by the average incremental utility, rather than average all the ICERs created in the PSA. Which would make sense as I updated their function code to include DSAICER, originally it was NMB in the function where I create DSAICER in the first place, so they wouldnt have had a DSAICER to average across all the runs. So it makes sense theyd have to go this way as they'll always be calculating costs and effects, but they won't always know what you are interested in as your final measure, i.e., ICER, NMB, etc.,

# Knowing that DSAICER reflects the ICERs across simulations means I am able to order them from smallest to largest to allow me to determine how many ICERs from the PSA are at or below the WTP threshold, that is, how many are cost-effective. This information allows me to report the following when I see that for Ireland 18 ICERs are < = 45000


# 18 is what percent of 10000?
# 18 is P% of 10000
# Equation: Y = P% * X
# Solving our equation for P
# P% = Y/X
# P% = 18/10000
# p = 0.0018
# Convert decimal to percent:
# P% = 0.0018 * 100 = 0.18%

# That is, less than 1% of the simulations (0.18%) were cost-effective.

# so 100-0.18, 99.82% of simulations were not cost-effective. 

# And the CEAC I created reflects this, you'll see that in the CEAC for Ireland, the probability of cost-effectiveness hovers at around 0 for standard of care up until WTP thresholds go above 50k, at which point it starts to climb (slowly).

# And that's really the whole point of the CEAC, it's fed by the PSA and basically puts the PSA ICERs in order from smallest to biggest so you can see what percentage of them fall under the different WTP thresholds. Try to remember that the CEAC is just taking the PSA values for ICERs and putting them on a graph that shows how many are under the WTP threshold described at the bottom.

# So, basically we make a psa object for Dampack where df_c is the dataframe of costs from the Markov model being applied to the PSA data, and df_e is the data.frame of effectiveness from the Markov model being applied to the PSA dataset, the parameters that are included are those from the PSA analysis, which we fed into df_PA_input above (df_PA_input<-) and the two strategies are SoC and Exp.

# I added the "currency" section to the above so that my PSA plots would stop printing out with dollar signs, per this link: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dampack/vignettes/psa_analysis.html also available here: web.archive.org/web/20220802010424/https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dampack/vignettes/psa_analysis.html

# Also, initially the above was strategies    = c("SoC", "Exp"), but I changed this to strategies    = c("SoC", "Bev"), as the scatter plot and CEAC diagrams produced then had Bev written on them under strategies instead of Exp, which made what we were doing a lot clearer.

#save(c_PFS_Folfox, c_PFS_Bevacizumab, c_OS_Folfiri, administration_cost, c_AE1, c_AE2, c_AE3, Minimum_c_PFS_Folfox, Maximum_c_PFS_Folfox, Minimum_c_OS_Folfiri, Maximum_c_OS_Folfiri, Minimum_c_PFS_Bevacizumab, Maximum_c_PFS_Bevacizumab, Minimum_administration_cost, Maximum_administration_cost, Minimum_c_AE1, Maximum_c_AE1, Minimum_c_AE2, Maximum_c_AE2, Minimum_c_AE3, Maximum_c_AE3, n_wtp, Incremental_Cost, Incremental_Effect, ICER, tc_d_Exp, tc_d_SoC, country_name, file=paste("my_data_", country_name[1], ".rda", sep = ""))

# This creates an RDA file with all the parameters I created in this file in it.

# Next, in my Markdown file that calls this file, I will read in these parameters and name each of them after the country I am studying, to give me country specific values in my analysis.

## 08.3.3 Table Describing Parameters

To build a Table describing parameters, you click on the Table button at the top, and design it in there.
Then to include the parameter values automatically as they are updated you fill in the parameter name you want, highlight it in the cell and click \</\> from above to put it in a code block.
You do the same for gamma, etc., put this in code blocks also.
